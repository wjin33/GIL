	abstract = {The Discrete Equivalent Wing Crack Damage (DEWCD) model formulated in this paper couples micro-mechanics and Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) principles. At the scale of the Representative Elementary Volume (REV), damage is obtained by integrating crack densities over the unit sphere, which represents all possible crack plane orientations. The unit sphere is discretized into 42 integration points. The damage yield criterion is expressed at the microscopic scale: if a crack is in tension, crack growth is controlled by a mode I fracture mechanics criterion; if a crack is in compression, the shear stress that applies at its faces is projected on the directions considered in the numerical integration scheme, and cracks perpendicular to these projected force components grow according to a mode I fracture mechanics criterion. The projection of shear stresses into a set of tensile forces allows predicting the occurrence of wing cracks at the tips of pre-existing defects. We assume that all of the resulting mode I cracks do not interact, and we adopt a dilute homogenization scheme. A hardening law is introduced to account for subcritical crack propagation, and non-associated flow rules are adopted for damage and irreversible strains induced by residual crack displacements after unloading. The DEWCD model depends on only 6 constitutive parameters which all have a sound physical meaning and can be determined by direct measurements in the laboratory. The DEWCD model is calibrated and validated against triaxial compression tests performed on Bakken Shale. In order to highlight the advantages of the DEWCD model over previous anisotropic damage models proposed for rocks, we simulated: (a) A uniaxial tension followed by unloading and reloading in compression; and (b) Uniaxial compression loading cycles of increasing amplitude. We compared the results obtained with the DEWCD model with those obtained with a micro-mechanical model and with a CDM model, both calibrated against the same experimental dataset as the DEWCD model. The three models predict a non linear-stress/strain relationship and damage-induced anisotropy. The micro-mechanical model can capture unilateral effects. The CDM model can capture the occurrence of irreversible strains. The DEWCD model can capture both unilateral effects and irreversible strains. In addition, the DEWCD model can predict the apparent increase of strength and ductility in compression when the confinement increases and the increasing hysteresis on unloading-reloading paths as damage increases. The DEWCD model is the only of the three models tested that provides realistic values of yield stress and strength in tension and compression. This is a significant advancement in the theoretical modeling of brittle solids. Future work will be devoted to the prediction of crack coalescence and to the modeling of the material response with interacting micro-cracks.},

	abstract = {In situ gas extraction is the main measure adopted by mines to achieve mining safety standards. Coal permeability is significantly influenced by coal shrinkage during gas release. Based on effective stress and additional damage that resulted from gas extraction, a unique model was proposed to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of coal permeability within the effective influence zone. Calculation models for the conditions of one and two extracting boreholes were developed. A parametric study on both two models was also conducted, in which the effect of extraction time, extraction pressure, interval between two boreholes, and extraction pressure combination were qualitatively analyzed. The results demonstrated that with the increase of extraction time, gas extraction can result in less permeability reduction in the beginning but can enhance permeability. Coal permeability obviously increases when extraction time increases but gradually stabilizes, presenting “high middle and low around” surrounding the extracting borehole. Meanwhile, a decreasing relative amplification implies that permeability ratio does not increase linearly with the increase in extraction pressure. Both intervals between two extracting boreholes and different combinations of extraction pressure significantly influence the distribution of coal permeability. A comparison with some previous permeability studies was conducted to validate the proposed model, and the predicted evolution results matched the permeability testing data. In conclusion, the proposed model is consistent with the phenomenon in real engineering, and the model results can provide preliminary guidance for the design of extracting borehole distribution.},

	abstract = {Poor flowability of compressible biomass particles poses severe handling challenges in all processes of biorefineries, which results in poor energy-yielding in conversion. This paper presents the characterization of the flow behavior of a widely used compressible biomass material (ground loblolly pine) using a combination of physical characterization and numerical simulation. An advanced hypoplastic model with implementation and validation in Abaqus VUMAT is adopted. A workflow is established to calibrate material parameters directly from index tests, an oedometer test, and a Schulze ring shear test, and indirectly from numerical simulations of those tests. The finite element simulation of axial shear tests and hopper flow tests using the calibrated hypoplastic model is shown to capture key flow attributes, such as the maximum shear stress in shear tests, as well as the mass flow rate and flow pattern in hopper. The results demonstrate that a subset of the laboratory tests needs to allow large strains for adequate characterization of compressible granular flow, and numerical models developed for non-compressible materials can accurately predict the flow behavior of compressible biomass material, even though strain magnitudes are not scaled correctly. This study provides a potent tool to decipher and resolve material handling upsets in biorefineries and other energy industries that utilize forest products.},

	url = {https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/55353},
	abstract = {The objective of this work is to simulate mode II multi-scale fracture propagation in shale by coupling a continuum anisotropic damage model with a Cohesive Zone Model (CZM). The Continuum Damage Mechanics – based Differential Stress Induced Damage (DSID) model is used to represent micro-scale crack evolution. DSID parameters were calibrated against pre-peak points of stress/strain curves obtained experimentally during triaxial compression tests performed in Bakken shale. A bilinear CZM is employed to represent macroscale fracture propagation. We calculated the effective shear modulus of a continuum that contained a distribution of parallel cracks according to the DSID model (which does not account for crack interactions) and according to Kachanov’s micromechanical model (which accounts for crack interactions). Simulations confirmed that above a crack density or damage of 0.3, crack interactions could not be ignored, and we used that threshold to define the transition between continuum damage propagation and discrete fracture propagation and subsequently, to calibrate the shear cohesive strength of the CZM. The CZM cohesive energy release rate was determined by calibrating a numerical model of triaxial compression test against experimental data obtained on Bakken shale. The cylindrical sample was modeled with a CZM to pre-define an inclined cohesive fracture, and the DSID model was assigned to the surrounding elements. We used our calibrated CZM-DSID model to simulate a biaxial compression test in plane strain. Results clearly show that the proposed modeling strategy not only allows simulating the advancement of macro-fracture tips, but also captures the inception and growth of micro-cracks that form damaged zones, as well as the transition between smeared damage and discrete fracture.},
