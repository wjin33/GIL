	abstract = {The Discrete Equivalent Wing Crack Damage (DEWCD) model formulated in this paper couples micro-mechanics and Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) principles. At the scale of the Representative Elementary Volume (REV), damage is obtained by integrating crack densities over the unit sphere, which represents all possible crack plane orientations. The unit sphere is discretized into 42 integration points. The damage yield criterion is expressed at the microscopic scale: if a crack is in tension, crack growth is controlled by a mode I fracture mechanics criterion; if a crack is in compression, the shear stress that applies at its faces is projected on the directions considered in the numerical integration scheme, and cracks perpendicular to these projected force components grow according to a mode I fracture mechanics criterion. The projection of shear stresses into a set of tensile forces allows predicting the occurrence of wing cracks at the tips of pre-existing defects. We assume that all of the resulting mode I cracks do not interact, and we adopt a dilute homogenization scheme. A hardening law is introduced to account for subcritical crack propagation, and non-associated flow rules are adopted for damage and irreversible strains induced by residual crack displacements after unloading. The DEWCD model depends on only 6 constitutive parameters which all have a sound physical meaning and can be determined by direct measurements in the laboratory. The DEWCD model is calibrated and validated against triaxial compression tests performed on Bakken Shale. In order to highlight the advantages of the DEWCD model over previous anisotropic damage models proposed for rocks, we simulated: (a) A uniaxial tension followed by unloading and reloading in compression; and (b) Uniaxial compression loading cycles of increasing amplitude. We compared the results obtained with the DEWCD model with those obtained with a micro-mechanical model and with a CDM model, both calibrated against the same experimental dataset as the DEWCD model. The three models predict a non linear-stress/strain relationship and damage-induced anisotropy. The micro-mechanical model can capture unilateral effects. The CDM model can capture the occurrence of irreversible strains. The DEWCD model can capture both unilateral effects and irreversible strains. In addition, the DEWCD model can predict the apparent increase of strength and ductility in compression when the confinement increases and the increasing hysteresis on unloading-reloading paths as damage increases. The DEWCD model is the only of the three models tested that provides realistic values of yield stress and strength in tension and compression. This is a significant advancement in the theoretical modeling of brittle solids. Future work will be devoted to the prediction of crack coalescence and to the modeling of the material response with interacting micro-cracks.},

	abstract = {In situ gas extraction is the main measure adopted by mines to achieve mining safety standards. Coal permeability is significantly influenced by coal shrinkage during gas release. Based on effective stress and additional damage that resulted from gas extraction, a unique model was proposed to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of coal permeability within the effective influence zone. Calculation models for the conditions of one and two extracting boreholes were developed. A parametric study on both two models was also conducted, in which the effect of extraction time, extraction pressure, interval between two boreholes, and extraction pressure combination were qualitatively analyzed. The results demonstrated that with the increase of extraction time, gas extraction can result in less permeability reduction in the beginning but can enhance permeability. Coal permeability obviously increases when extraction time increases but gradually stabilizes, presenting “high middle and low around” surrounding the extracting borehole. Meanwhile, a decreasing relative amplification implies that permeability ratio does not increase linearly with the increase in extraction pressure. Both intervals between two extracting boreholes and different combinations of extraction pressure significantly influence the distribution of coal permeability. A comparison with some previous permeability studies was conducted to validate the proposed model, and the predicted evolution results matched the permeability testing data. In conclusion, the proposed model is consistent with the phenomenon in real engineering, and the model results can provide preliminary guidance for the design of extracting borehole distribution.},
