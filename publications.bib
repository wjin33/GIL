	abstract = {The Discrete Equivalent Wing Crack Damage (DEWCD) model formulated in this paper couples micro-mechanics and Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) principles. At the scale of the Representative Elementary Volume (REV), damage is obtained by integrating crack densities over the unit sphere, which represents all possible crack plane orientations. The unit sphere is discretized into 42 integration points. The damage yield criterion is expressed at the microscopic scale: if a crack is in tension, crack growth is controlled by a mode I fracture mechanics criterion; if a crack is in compression, the shear stress that applies at its faces is projected on the directions considered in the numerical integration scheme, and cracks perpendicular to these projected force components grow according to a mode I fracture mechanics criterion. The projection of shear stresses into a set of tensile forces allows predicting the occurrence of wing cracks at the tips of pre-existing defects. We assume that all of the resulting mode I cracks do not interact, and we adopt a dilute homogenization scheme. A hardening law is introduced to account for subcritical crack propagation, and non-associated flow rules are adopted for damage and irreversible strains induced by residual crack displacements after unloading. The DEWCD model depends on only 6 constitutive parameters which all have a sound physical meaning and can be determined by direct measurements in the laboratory. The DEWCD model is calibrated and validated against triaxial compression tests performed on Bakken Shale. In order to highlight the advantages of the DEWCD model over previous anisotropic damage models proposed for rocks, we simulated: (a) A uniaxial tension followed by unloading and reloading in compression; and (b) Uniaxial compression loading cycles of increasing amplitude. We compared the results obtained with the DEWCD model with those obtained with a micro-mechanical model and with a CDM model, both calibrated against the same experimental dataset as the DEWCD model. The three models predict a non linear-stress/strain relationship and damage-induced anisotropy. The micro-mechanical model can capture unilateral effects. The CDM model can capture the occurrence of irreversible strains. The DEWCD model can capture both unilateral effects and irreversible strains. In addition, the DEWCD model can predict the apparent increase of strength and ductility in compression when the confinement increases and the increasing hysteresis on unloading-reloading paths as damage increases. The DEWCD model is the only of the three models tested that provides realistic values of yield stress and strength in tension and compression. This is a significant advancement in the theoretical modeling of brittle solids. Future work will be devoted to the prediction of crack coalescence and to the modeling of the material response with interacting micro-cracks.},

	abstract = {In situ gas extraction is the main measure adopted by mines to achieve mining safety standards. Coal permeability is significantly influenced by coal shrinkage during gas release. Based on effective stress and additional damage that resulted from gas extraction, a unique model was proposed to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of coal permeability within the effective influence zone. Calculation models for the conditions of one and two extracting boreholes were developed. A parametric study on both two models was also conducted, in which the effect of extraction time, extraction pressure, interval between two boreholes, and extraction pressure combination were qualitatively analyzed. The results demonstrated that with the increase of extraction time, gas extraction can result in less permeability reduction in the beginning but can enhance permeability. Coal permeability obviously increases when extraction time increases but gradually stabilizes, presenting “high middle and low around” surrounding the extracting borehole. Meanwhile, a decreasing relative amplification implies that permeability ratio does not increase linearly with the increase in extraction pressure. Both intervals between two extracting boreholes and different combinations of extraction pressure significantly influence the distribution of coal permeability. A comparison with some previous permeability studies was conducted to validate the proposed model, and the predicted evolution results matched the permeability testing data. In conclusion, the proposed model is consistent with the phenomenon in real engineering, and the model results can provide preliminary guidance for the design of extracting borehole distribution.},

	abstract = {Poor flowability of compressible biomass particles poses severe handling challenges in all processes of biorefineries, which results in poor energy-yielding in conversion. This paper presents the characterization of the flow behavior of a widely used compressible biomass material (ground loblolly pine) using a combination of physical characterization and numerical simulation. An advanced hypoplastic model with implementation and validation in Abaqus VUMAT is adopted. A workflow is established to calibrate material parameters directly from index tests, an oedometer test, and a Schulze ring shear test, and indirectly from numerical simulations of those tests. The finite element simulation of axial shear tests and hopper flow tests using the calibrated hypoplastic model is shown to capture key flow attributes, such as the maximum shear stress in shear tests, as well as the mass flow rate and flow pattern in hopper. The results demonstrate that a subset of the laboratory tests needs to allow large strains for adequate characterization of compressible granular flow, and numerical models developed for non-compressible materials can accurately predict the flow behavior of compressible biomass material, even though strain magnitudes are not scaled correctly. This study provides a potent tool to decipher and resolve material handling upsets in biorefineries and other energy industries that utilize forest products.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work is to simulate mode II multi-scale fracture propagation in shale by coupling a continuum anisotropic damage model with a Cohesive Zone Model (CZM). The Continuum Damage Mechanics – based Differential Stress Induced Damage (DSID) model is used to represent micro-scale crack evolution. DSID parameters were calibrated against pre-peak points of stress/strain curves obtained experimentally during triaxial compression tests performed in Bakken shale. A bilinear CZM is employed to represent macroscale fracture propagation. We calculated the effective shear modulus of a continuum that contained a distribution of parallel cracks according to the DSID model (which does not account for crack interactions) and according to Kachanov’s micromechanical model (which accounts for crack interactions). Simulations confirmed that above a crack density or damage of 0.3, crack interactions could not be ignored, and we used that threshold to define the transition between continuum damage propagation and discrete fracture propagation and subsequently, to calibrate the shear cohesive strength of the CZM. The CZM cohesive energy release rate was determined by calibrating a numerical model of triaxial compression test against experimental data obtained on Bakken shale. The cylindrical sample was modeled with a CZM to pre-define an inclined cohesive fracture, and the DSID model was assigned to the surrounding elements. We used our calibrated CZM-DSID model to simulate a biaxial compression test in plane strain. Results clearly show that the proposed modeling strategy not only allows simulating the advancement of macro-fracture tips, but also captures the inception and growth of micro-cracks that form damaged zones, as well as the transition between smeared damage and discrete fracture.},

	url = {https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/53678},
	abstract = {The objective of this work is to model the influence of shear stresses induced by viscous fluid flow on wellbore spalling. We simulated a drop of stress and pore pressure at the wall of a meter-scale borehole with a plane strain Finite Element model. The rock mass was modeled as a jointed continuum. Block sliding was predicted from the tangential displacements in the joint after the shear failure criterion was reached. Simulations show that: (1) Higher far field stresses induce more normal stress in the joints, which prevents the occurrence of shear plastic strains in the joints and reduces block sliding at the wall; (2) Shear stresses and consequent shear plastic strains that are induced by viscous fluid flow in the joints are higher for higher fluid viscosities, and decrease over time as the blocks on each side of the joint slide on each other; (3) In joints that are in contact with the borehole, a change of one order of magnitude in the fluid viscosity results in a change in joint shear stress by a factor of 2. Results suggest that if drainage had been simulated over a longer period of time or for a smaller borehole diameter, the failure criterion would have been reached on a larger zone around the borehole, which could have a critical impact on the risk of borehole spalling. The numerical approach proposed in this work is expected to be useful to recommend wellbore operation modes so as to avoid excessive spalling and clogging.},

Challenges in theoretical and numerical modeling include the distinction between tensile and compressive fracture propagation modes, mesh dependency during softening, and lack of convergence when several critical points are expected on the stress/strain curve. To overcome these issues, we formulate a nonlocal micromechanics based anisotropic damage model. A dilute homogenization scheme is adopted for calculating the deformation energy of the Representative Elementary Volume due to the displacement jumps at open and closed micro-cracks. Tension (respectively compression) damage criteria are expressed in terms of non-local equivalent strains defined in terms of positive principal strains (respectively deviatoric strains). Constitutive parameters are calibrated against published experimental data for concrete and shale. We employ the arc-length control method to solve boundary-value problems with the finite element package OOFEM: the algorithm allows capturing softening, snap back and snap through. We simulate the development of the compression damage zone around a cavity under various stress levels at the wall and far field, and the softening behavior consequent to tensile fracture propagation during a three-point bending test. No mesh dependency is noted during softening as long as micro-cracks do not interact.},

	abstract = {We propose a numerical method that couples a cohesive zone model (CZM) and a finite element-based continuum damage mechanics (CDM) model. The CZM represents a mode II macro-fracture, and CDM finite elements (FE) represent the damage zone of the CZM. The coupled CZM/CDM model can capture the flow of energy that takes place between the bulk material that forms the matrix and the macroscopic fracture surfaces. The CDM model, which does not account for micro-crack interaction, is calibrated against triaxial compression tests performed on Bakken shale, so as to reproduce the stress/strain curve before the failure peak. Based on a comparison with Kachanov's micro-mechanical model, we confirm that the critical micro-crack density value equal to 0.3 reflects the point at which crack interaction cannot be neglected. The CZM is assigned a pure mode II cohesive law that accounts for the dependence of the shear strength and energy release rate on confining pressure. The cohesive shear strength of the CZM is calibrated by calculating the shear stress necessary to reach a CDM damage of 0.3 during a direct shear test. We find that the shear cohesive strength of the CZM depends linearly on the confining pressure. Triaxial compression tests are simulated, in which the shale sample is modeled as an FE CDM continuum that contains a predefined thin cohesive zone representing the idealized shear fracture plane. The shear energy release rate of the CZM is fitted in order to match to the post-peak stress/strain curves obtained during experimental tests performed on Bakken shale. We find that the energy release rate depends linearly on the shear cohesive strength. We then use the calibrated shale rheology to simulate the propagation of a meter-scale mode II fracture. Under low confining pressure, the macroscopic crack (CZM) and its damaged zone (CDM) propagate simultaneously (i.e., during the same loading increments). Under high confining pressure, the fracture propagates in slip-friction, that is, the debonding of the cohesive zone alternates with the propagation of continuum damage. The computational method is applicable to a range of geological injection problems including hydraulic fracturing and fluid storage and should be further enhanced by the addition of mode I and mixed mode (I+II+III) propagation.

First, a series of uniaxial compression tests for Longmaxi shale demonstrates that its apparent elastic modulus ranges from 14.9 to 18.8GPa. Then, by collecting experimental data and performing a Monte–Carlo simulation method, the NF network is built within the target 3D shale formation, and the equivalent elastic modulus values along a given wellbore wall are estimated. The results reveal that the elastic parameters of shale formations exhibit high directional dependency associated with the presence of BPs and NFs; a higher NF density is also found to lower the BP-induced anisotropy. Wider application of Monte–Carlo simulations in future studies is recommended to calculate the deformation issues of large-scale numerical petroleum engineering modeling when considering the influence of NFs.},

	abstract = {The discrete damage model presented in this paper accounts for 42 non-interacting crack microplanes directions. At the scale of the representative volume element, the free enthalpy is the sum of the elastic energy stored in the non-damaged bulk material and in the displacement jumps at crack faces. Closed cracks propagate in the pure mode II, whereas open cracks propagate in the mixed mode (I/II). The elastic domain is at the intersection of the yield surfaces of the activated crack families, and thus describes a non-smooth surface. In order to solve for the 42 crack densities, a Closest Point Projection algorithm is adopted locally. The representative volume element inelastic strain is calculated iteratively using the Newton–Raphson method. The proposed damage model was rigorously calibrated for both compressive and tensile stress paths. Finite element method simulations of triaxial compression tests showed that the transition between brittle and ductile behavior at increasing confining pressure can be captured. The cracks’ density, orientation, and location predicted in the simulations are in agreement with experimental observations made during compression and tension tests, and accurately show the difference between tensile and compressive strength. Plane stress tension tests simulated for a fiber-reinforced brittle material also demonstrated that the model can be used to interpret crack patterns, design composite structures and recommend reparation techniques for structural elements subjected to multiple damage mechanisms.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the theoretical formulation and numerical implementation of an anisotropic damage model for materials with intrinsic transverse isotropy. Crack initiation and propagation are modeled by phenomenological damage evolution laws, controlled by four equivalent strain measures. The latter are constructed so as to distinguish the mechanical response of the material in tension and compression, along the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane and within the bedding plane. To avoid mesh dependency induced by softening, equivalent strains are replaced by nonlocal counterparts, defined as weighted averages over a neighborhood scaled by two internal length parameters. Finite Element equations are solved with a normal plane arc length control algorithm, which allows passing limit points in case of snap back or snap through. The model is calibrated against triaxial compression tests performed on shale, for different confinements and loading orientations relative to the bedding plane. Gauss point simulations confirm that the model successfully captures the variation of uniaxial tensile strength with respect to the bedding orientation. Finite Element simulations of three-point bending tests and compression splitting tests show that nonlocal enhancement indeed avoids mesh dependency, and that the axial and transverse dimensions of the damage process zone are scaled by the two characteristic lengths. Results further show that the damage process zone is direction dependent both in tension and compression. The model can be used for any type of textured brittle material; it allows representing several concurrent damage mechanisms in the macroscopic response and interpreting the failure mechanisms that control the damage process zone.},

Cyclic oedometer tests with increased magnitude of compressive stress and Schulze ring shear tests are performed to characterize material compressibility and shear behavior. The laboratory tests yield stress-strain curves, density-stress curves and Mohr-Coulomb shear envelopes, which are then used directly and indirectly to calibrate elasticity, as well as cap and shear failure parameters of the MDPC model. Full size 3D Schulze ring shear tests are modeled in Abaqus with calibrated model parameters, and the simulated Mohr-Coulomb envelops match well against experimental results, indicating the stress state within the shear band of the ring shear test is close to triaxial compression. The modeling results also show the MDPC model does not predict dilation followed by constant volume as observed by experiments.

Computational modeling, including the discrete element method (DEM) and continuum-based finite-element/volume methods, may offer scientific insight and predictive capabilities for the flow of milled biomass in hoppers and feeders. This article (Part II) presents a review of current state-of-the-art continuum models for the flow of milled biomass, whereas DEM models are reviewed in a companion article (Part I). Advances of numerical methods to solve the global governing equations are discussed first, followed by a comprehensive review of constitutive models for granular materials, including Drucker–Prager, hypoplastic, Cambridge-type, inertial-rheology, and nonlocal granular fluidity models. Specifically, we provide in-depth discussion on the suitability of those models for milled lignocellulosic biomass materials in terms of nonlinear elasticity, dependence of flow strength on pressure, density and shear rate, and compaction (dilation) associated with hardening (softening). Our study shows that, despite the recent advances in continuum granular flow modeling, the most suitable constitutive models still need further development to account for material parametrization, multiflow regimes, and multiscale behavior before they can be reliably used to optimize the design and operation of biomass handling systems.},

The present review on DEM is primarily focused on the features and suitability of various particle shape models for different types of milled biomass because particle shape is the predominant attribute controlling the flow behavior of complex-shaped granular material. The general strengths and weaknesses in the applicability of those models for the milled biomass modeling are summarized. In particular, comments are provided to balance the numerical model capabilities and the computational cost for the development of DEM models. To our best knowledge, this is the first-of-its-kind review on DEM specifically for biomass. Our study indicates that the current DEM models require further development, calibration, and validation based on a deep understanding of biomass particle contact mechanics and experimental data support before they can be reliably used for predictive simulations in handling and feeding systems.},

Yet, the presence of obstacles can be highly disruptive to the root system. We grew wheat seedlings in sealed petri dishes without obstacle and in custom 3D-printed rhizoboxes containing obstacles. Time-lapse photography was used to reconstruct the wheat root morphology network. We used the reconstructed wheat root network without obstacle to calibrate an RSA model implemented in the R-SWMS software. The root network with obstacles allowed calibrating the parameters of a new function that models the influence of rigid obstacles on wheat root growth. Experimental results show that the presence of a rigid obstacle does not affect the growth rate of the wheat root axes, but that it does influence the root trajectory after the main axis has passed the obstacle. The growth recovery time, i.e. the time for the main root axis to recover its geotropism-driven growth, is proportional to the time during which the main axis grows along the obstacle. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between experimental and numerical results show that the proposed model successfully simulates wheat RSA growth around obstacles. Our results suggest that wheat roots follow patterns that could inspire the design of adaptive engineering flow networks.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a numerical method is proposed to simulate multi-scale fracture propagation driven by ﬂuid injection in transversely isotropic porous media. Intrinsic anisotropy is accounted for at the continuum scale, by using a damage model in which two equivalent strains are deﬁned to distinguish mechanical behavior in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the layer. Nonlocal equivalent strains are calculated by integration and are directly introduced in the damage evolution law. When the weighted damage exceeds a certain threshold, the transition from continuum damage to cohesive fracture is performed by dynamically inserting cohesive segments. Diffusion equations are used to model ﬂuid ﬂow inside the porous matrix and within the macro-fracture, in which conductivity is obtained by Darcy’s law and the cubic law, respectively. In the fractured elements, the displacement and pore pressure ﬁelds are discretized by using the XFEM technique. Interpolation on fracture elements is enriched with jump functions for displacements and with level set-based distance functions for ﬂuid pressure, which ensures that displacements are discontinuous across the fracture, but that the pressure ﬁeld remains continuous. After spatial and temporal discretization, the model is implemented in a Matlab code. Simulations are carried out in plane strain. The results validate the formulation and implementation of the proposed model and further demonstrate that it can account for material and stress anisotropy.},

Microcrack initiation and propagation prior to coalescence are represented by a nonlocal anisotropic Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) model in which the crack density is calculated explicitly. A damage threshold is defined to mark the beginning of crack coalescence. When that threshold is reached, a cohesive segment is inserted in the mesh to replace a portion of the damage process zone by a segment of discrete fracture. Discretization is done with the extended Finite Element Method (XFEM), which makes it possible to simulate fracture propagation without assigning the fracture path a priori. Rigorous calibration procedures are established for the cohesive strength (related to the damage threshold) and for the cohesive energy release rate, to ensure the balance of energy dissipated at the micro and macro scales. The XFEM-based tool is implemented into an open source object-oriented numerical package (OOFEM), and used to simulate wedge splitting and three-point bending tests. Results demonstrate that the proposed numerical method captures the entire failure process in mode I, from a mesh-independent diffuse damage zone to a localized fracture.

In this work, the flow behavior of loblolly pine chips, including the mass flow rate and the critical outlet width, in a wedge-shaped hopper is investigated by combining physical experiments and numerical simulations. Comprehensive characterization of the flow response affected by the two material attributes (initial packing, particle density) and the three operational parameters (hopper outlet width, hopper inclination, and surcharge) is conducted. The results show that the hopper outlet width linearly controls the mass flow rate, while the hopper inclination angle controls the critical outlet size. The packing determines whether the flow is smooth or surging, and the surcharge-induced compaction creates flow impedance. The magnitude of these influences varies from a slender hopper with a low inclination angle to a flat-bottom silo. These findings provide guidance for hopper operation in the material handling industry and shed light on the construction of a novel design method for material handling equipment in biorefineries.},

	abstract = {The upstream of bioenergy industry has suffered from unreliable operations of granular biomass feedstocks in handling equipment. Computational modeling, including continuum-mechanics models and discrete-particle models, offers insightful understandings and predictive capabilities on the flow of milled biomass and can assist equipment design and optimization. This paper presents a benchmark study on the fidelity of the continuum and discrete modeling approaches for predicting granular biomass flow. We first introduce the constitutive law of the continuum-mechanics model and the contact law of the coarse-grained discrete-particle model, with model parameters calibrated against laboratory characterization tests of the milled loblolly pine. Three classical granular material flow systems (i.e., a lab-scale rotating drum, a pilot-scale hopper, and a full-scale inclined plane) are then simulated using the two models with the same initial and boundary conditions as the physical experiments. The close agreement of the numerical predictions with the experimental measurements on the hopper mass flow rate, the hopper critical outlet width, the material stopping thickness on the inclined plane, and the dynamic angle of repose, clearly indicates that the two methods can capture the critical flow behavior of granular biomass. The qualitative comparison shows that the continuum-mechanics model outperforms in parameterization of materials and wall friction, and large-scale systems, while the discrete-particle model is more preferred for discontinuous flow systems at smaller scales. Industry stakeholders can use these findings as guidance for choosing appropriate numerical tools to model biomass material flow in part of the optimization of material handling equipment in biorefineries.},

	abstract = {One dominant challenge facing the development of biorefineries is achieving consistent system throughput with highly variant biomass feedstock quality and handling performance. Current handling unit operations are adapted from other sectors (primarily agriculture), where some simplifying assumptions about granular mechanics and flow performance do not translate well to a highly compressible and anisotropic material with nonlinear time- and stress-dependent properties. This work explores the shear and frictional properties of loblolly pine at multiple experimental test apparatus and particle scales to elucidate a property window that defines the shear behavior over a range of material attributes (particle size, size distribution, moisture content, etc.). In general, it was observed that the bulk internal friction and apparent cohesion depend strongly on both the stress state of the sample in granular shear testers and the overall particle size and distribution span. For equipment designed to characterize the quasi-static shear stress failure of bulk materials ranging from 50 to 1,000 ml in test volume, similar test results were observed for finely milled particles (50\% passing size of 1.4 mm) with a narrow size distribution (span between 10 and 90\% passing size of 0.9 mm), while stress chaining and over-torque issues persisted for the bench-scale test apparatus for larger particle sizes or widely dispersed sample sizes. Measurement of the anisotropic particle–particle friction ranged from coefficients of approximately 0.20 to 0.45 and resulted in significantly higher and more variable friction measurements for larger particle sizes and in perpendicular alignment orientations. To supplement these laboratory-scale properties, this work explores the flow of loblolly pine and Douglas fir through a pilot-scale wedge-shaped hopper and a screw feeder. For the gravity-driven hopper flow, the critical arching distance and mass discharge rate ranged from approximately 10 to 30 mm and 2 to 16 tons/hour, respectively, for both materials, where the arching distance depends strongly on the overall particle size and depends less on the hopper inclination angle. Comparatively, the auger feeder was found to be much more impacted by the size of the particles, where smaller particles had a more consistent and stable flow while consuming less power.},

In this study, a machine-learning-assisted computational framework is presented to identify HT-RTES site with optimal performance metrics by combining physics-based simulation with stochastic hydrogeologic formation and thermal energy storage operation parameters, artificial neural network regression of the simulation data, and genetic algorithm-enabled multi-objective optimization. A doublet well configuration with a layered (aquitard-aquifer-aquitard) generic reservoir is simulated for cases of continuous operation and seasonal-cycle operation scenarios. Neural network-based surrogate models are developed for the two scenarios and applied to generate the Pareto fronts of the HT-RTES performance for four potential HT-RTES sites. The developed Pareto optimal solutions indicate the performance of HT-RTES is operation-scenario (i.e., fluid cycle) and reservoir-site dependent, and the performance metrics have competing effects for a given site and a given fluid cycle. The developed neural network models can be applied to identify suitable sites for HT-RTES, and the proposed framework sheds light on the design of resilient HT-RTES systems.},

Handling issues such as hopper clogging and auger jamming are attributed to knowledge gaps between existing handling units designed for bulk solids and their suitability for milled biomass with high compressibility. This work investigates various flow behaviors of granular woody biomass in wedge-shaped hoppers. Hopper flow physical experiments and numerical simulations are conducted to study the influence of the critical material attributes and critical processing parameters on the flow pattern, arching, and throughput. The results show that (1) the preferred flow pattern, mass flow, can be achieved by controlling the material’s internal friction angle, hopper inclination, and hopper wall friction; (2) hopper arching, governed by the competing gravity-driven force against flow resistance from material internal friction and material–wall friction, can be controlled by the hopper wall friction angle and the inclination angle; and (3) flow throughput can be accurately estimated from our empirical equation with inputs of hopper outlet geometry and particle-scale to bulk-scale material attributes. This study elucidates woody biomass flow physics and provides guidance for industrial equipment design.},

To overcome these obstacles, a robust and accurate model to simulate the flow of granular biomass is indispensable. However, conventional mesh-based numerical codes are limited by inherent mesh distortion in simulating large deformation that commonly occurs in granular biomass handling. In this study, we propose a graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated meshless Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code to model the flow of granular biomass materials. A modified void ratio-based mass conversation, a hybrid particle-to-particle/surface frictional boundary treatment, and a hypoplastic constitutive model are implemented. Four numerical examples, an elastic block sliding on inclined planes, sand column collapse, Angle of Repose, and axial compression tests for pine chips, were simulated using the developed SPH code. The results demonstrate good agreement between numerical predictions and analytical and experimental data for all four examples, validating the SPH code and increasing confidence that it can be applied to simulate more complex granular biomass handling processes, such as hopper feeding or auger conveyance.},

	abstract = {Abstract. One of the critical challenges of the green energy transition is resolving the mismatch between energy generation provided by intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar and wind and the demand for energy. There is a need for large amounts of energy storage over a range of time scales (diurnal to seasonal) to better balance energy supply and demand. Subsurface geologic reservoirs provide the potential for storage of hot water that can be retrieved when needed and used for power generation or direct-use applications, such as district heating. It is important to identify potential issues associated with high-temperature reservoir thermal energy storage (HT-RTES) systems so that they can be mitigated, thus reducing the risks of these systems. This paper reviews past experiences from moderate and high-temperature reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) projects, along with hot water and steam flood enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations, to identify technical challenges encountered and evaluate possible ways to address them. Some of the identified technical problems that have impacted system performance include: 1) insufficient site characterization that failed to identify reservoir heterogeneity; 2) scaling resulting from precipitation of minerals having retrograde solubility that form with heating of formation brines; 3) corrosion from low pH or high salinity brines; 4) thermal breakthrough between hot and cold wells due to insufficient spacing. Proper design, characterization, construction, and operational practices can help reduce the risk of technical problems that could lead to reduced performance of these thermal energy storage systems.},

The good agreement between the experimental and numerical flow rates demonstrated the capability of the developed SPH solver in modeling the complicated flow of granular biomass materials. The impact of physical and numerical parameters is investigated, and the major results show that the hopper flow pattern is controlled by shear band evolution; hopper clogging is collectively influenced by the opening size, wall friction, and material packing, and the impact of material compressibility on the auger feed rate is minimal.

The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method provides an innovative framework for modeling brittle crack propagation with zero-thickness interface elements, which can accommodate extrinsic cohesive laws to avoid the artificial compliance required in intrinsic cohesive models. However, robust formulations and implementations of DG methods are critical in alleviating the well-known convergence issues for both crack nucleation and propagation with reduced instability. This paper presents a robust interface element formulation by modifying the incomplete interior penalty Galerkin (IIPG) method, which successfully avoids the initial element interface penetration across elements that occurs prior to crack nucleation, and thereby greatly reduces the instability issue as cracks open. We further verified and validated our implementation by using a bar tension test and a beam fracturing benchmark. The robustness of our proposed interface element method was demonstrated by a micromechanics fiber/matrix debonding problem with 64 fibers embedded in a bulk matrix.},

	abstract = {The commercialization of bioenergy has been significantly limited by various material handling issues due to the poor flowability of granular biomass materials. Addressing these issues demands a fundamental understanding of flow physics and robust models to predict the multi-regime flow behavior of biomass particles. In this study, we investigated the multi-regime flow behavior of loblolly pine chips, a widely used bioenergy feedstock, through combined experiments and simulations. A quasi-static hypoplastic model and a cross-regime Drucker–Prager (DP)-μ(I) model were utilized and validated against inclined plane flow experiments to understand the quasi-static and dense flow behavior of milled pine chips. The results show that along the inclined plane, loblolly pine chips mainly present in heap flow (varying thickness along the plane), and in plane flow (iso-thickness along the plane) only when the inclination closes to the material’s critical state internal friction angle. The results also show that the multi-regime DP-μ(I) model predicts a completely different velocity profile from the hypoplastic model. DP-μ(I) model can capture the flow behavior of pine chips in both flow regimes well but at the cost of extra parameter determination, and the shear-rate dependent rheology model can successfully capture the flow of elongated high-frictional particles. These findings advance the scientific understanding of the multi-regime flow behavior of granular biomass materials and shed light on formulating novel constitutive models to assist granular biomass handling in the bioenergy industry.},

	abstract = {Significant equipment downtime, mainly caused by the variable attributes and complex mechanical behavior of granular biomass materials, has challenged the great potential of biofuel generation. Expensive and time-consuming lab experiments are not affordable in fully characterizing material behavior for samples with all possible attributes. In this paper, we present data-driven modeling of the cyclic axial compression and ring-shear stress–strain behavior for granular biomass materials with different moisture contents and mean particle sizes. Laboratory characterization data of milled pine samples, with a mean particle size of 2, 4, and 6 mm and a moisture content of 0\%, 20\%, and 40\%, were employed to train two machine learning (ML) models independently. The sequential model takes a sequence of loading history into Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and predicts the next step of strain/stress with a feed-forward neural network. In contrast, the incremental model takes only the current state to predict the stiffness/compliance coefficient and compute the stress/strain increment. Both models account for material variations in particle sizes and moisture content. After training, both models demonstrate their high efficiency and accuracy in predicting the mechanical behavior of samples with a diverse set of unseen material properties, augmenting the existing laboratory data set. They also effectively capture the underlying physics, which involves increased compressibility as moisture content rises and a linear relationship between applied compression and shear strength. This effort established the foundation for comprehensive data-driven constitutive modeling tailored for unconventional granular materials.},

Electricity consumption for the data center cooling system becomes significant as the demand for data-intensive services increases. Although various technologies have been developed and integrated into the data center cooling system, there are limited high-efficiency alternatives for data center cooling. In this study, we designed a reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) system that stores cooling energy during winters and produces it during summers for data center cooling. We then demonstrated the techno-economic performance of the RTES incorporated with dry coolers and heat recovery for a year-round 5 MW cooling load. The RTES cooling production was reliable during the 20-year lifetime. We estimated the levelized cost of cooling as \$5/MWh, significantly lower than \$15/MWh for the base scenario where chillers and dry coolers supply the same cooling load without the RTES. We also estimated that the RTES-based cooling system annually avoids CO2 emissions up to 1488 tCO2e compared to the base case. These results highlight techno-economic feasibility and environmental benefits of the RTES and its potential to be deployed for various applications at large scales as well as for data center cooling.},

	abstract = {The promise of biomass-derived biofuels is often overshadowed by intricate material handling challenges such as hopper clogging and screw feeder jamming. These handling issues stem from the knowledge gap among particle-scale material properties (e.g., particle size), bulk-scale material attributes (e.g., relative density), macro-scale equipment design (e.g., hopper inclination), and flow performance (e.g., probability of clogging). This work combines physical experiments, validated numerical simulations, and data augmentation to develop a machine learning-based hopper design for flowing granular woody biomass materials. The flow behavior of granular biomass is simulated and validated against physical tests utilizing the developed smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) solver and a modified hypoplastic model. A comprehensive evaluation of the flow performance, including flow rate, flow stability, and flow pattern, is conducted on an extensive data set encompassing various biomass particle sizes, moisture contents, relative densities, and hopper operating conditions. A feed-forward neural network is trained and optimized with this data set to correlate cross-scale attributes with the flow performance metrics. The results reveal promising predictive accuracy on seen and unseen data sets. Further evaluation of how various input attributes affect the predicted flow performance metrics is carried out. The results indicate that hopper opening width primarily dictates flow throughput, while relative density, wall friction, inclination angle, and hopper opening width collectively impact flow stability. Additionally, flow patterns are predominantly governed by relative density, wall friction, and inclination angle. Moreover, the clogging potential is found to be exclusively characterized by the index dedicated to flow stability. The combination of high moisture contents, dense packing, smooth wall friction, low inclination angles, and small hopper opening widths substantially elevates the risk of unstable flows and clogging. This study serves as a potent design tool for flowing milled woody biomass materials in hoppers for all stakeholders in biorefineries and equipment manufacturing.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen-based technologies present a promising solution for the global energy transition. In addition to electrolytic production, subsurface geological formations provide a potential natural source of hydrogen. Iron-rich ultramafic rocks, in particular, are favorable for hydrogen generation through natural processes such as serpentinization. Naturally occurring reactions and migration can be enhanced through various types of stimulation, including thermal, hydraulic, and chemical treatment. Through numerical simulations, we analyzed the complex interplay of factors influencing the production and migration within the subsurface, emphasizing the importance of different stimulation techniques, catalysts, and conditions. Our findings indicate that key parameters, such as damage zone permeability and width, significantly impact producible hydrogen mass. Our results indicate that a combination of large damage zone widths, high permeability, and a stimulated reaction rate of 1 × 10-9 can yield economically viable production rates of up to 1kgs-1 at the wellhead. Moreover, the availability of ferrous iron, rather than the serpentinization rate itself, has been identified as the primary limiting factor in achieving economically sustainable hydrogen production. While an unstimulated rock volume of 0.165km3 yields only 45t of hydrogen in two years, various stimulation techniques can increase production to 18500t.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT:. Multistage hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized the oil and gas industry, particularly enabling the rapid growth of shale gas production in the U.S. However, for unconventional subsurface resource recovery, such as geothermal energy extraction in super-hot formations and in situ mineral leaching, hydraulic fracturing faces significant challenges, including packer leakage, short-circuiting, insufficient surface area for effective reactions, and water contamination. Electro-hydraulic fracturing - a combination of electric shocking, thermal shocking, and hydraulic fracturing - has been proposed to address these issues. Laboratory results have shown great promise for this technology in unconventional subsurface stimulation. However, scaling it up and deploying it in the field requires guidance from numerical simulations. This paper presents ELK (ELectro-fracKing), a computational tool designed to model electro-hydraulic fracturing processes. ELK is built on the open-source, parallel MOOSE (Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment) framework, using the finite-element method. ELK solves the momentum balance and mass conservation equations for hydraulic fracturing using numerical techniques such as the discontinuous Galerkin method, cohesive zone models, and multiphase, multicomponent fluid-flow simulations. This allows ELK to simulate proppant-fluid mixture-driven fracture propagation, proppant transport and settling, and fracture closure with proppant compaction. ELK solves the coupled dynamic hydromechanical governing equations for electric shocking (i.e., pulsed-power-induced fracturing). A damage model and permeability and stiffness evolution constitutive laws have been incorporated to simulate multi-fracture propagation in saturated environments. ELK solves part of the Maxwell Equations for thermal shock under low and constant current frequency (i.e., electro-quasi-static). We validate each modeling capability against laboratory results and analytical solutions. ELK offers a valuable computational tool for advancing unconventional subsurface resource extraction.},
