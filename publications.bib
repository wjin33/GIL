The model, which integrates many ®eld observations and thus generates a fracture network very similar to the natural fracture distribution in the reservoir, can predict the in¯uence of WRCI on the overall fractured reservoir. Factors aecting WRCI and the eect of WRCI on long-term performance of Hijiori deep reservoir (Japan) have been modelled. Simulated results show that ¯uid chemistry, initial rock temperature, magnitude of ¯ow rate and well spacing have a major eect on WRCI, and for such a multi-well Hijiori geothermal system, WRCI seems to make the ¯ow distribution tend towards uniformity. The model described deals solely with chemical interactions as a function of ¯ow rate and temperature, and takes no account of aperture variation as a result of thermoelastic eects. It is only a partial model, though it could form an important module of a coupled model. \# 2002 CNR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The numerical modeling approach is based on (a) a full hydro-mechanical coupling; and (b) explicit representation of a discrete fracture network (DFN). The reservoir-scale model has a core region of 1500 × 1200 × 1200 m3 volume around the positions of conceptual sub-horizontal well designs at the Fallon FORGE site. It contains relevant geological structure and a fracture network constructed and simplified using borehole data. Stimulation was modeled in six stages/zones along the horizontal well using both openhole (low injection rate at 5 kg/s) and cased borehole (combination of high, 80 kg/s, and low injection rates) completions to test the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing combined with hydro-shearing. The reservoir stimulation in the two models was analyzed and quantitatively assessed. Results indicate that the Fallon FORGE site is well suited for an EGS by multi-staged hydraulic stimulation using sub-horizontal wells. The conclusion is based on the evaluation of potential for fracture slip and aperture increase as functions of induced pressure changes and the orientations of the natural joints relative to the regional principal stresses. Advantages and limitations of explicit representation of the DFN in the numerical models are presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {The Discrete Equivalent Wing Crack Damage (DEWCD) model formulated in this paper couples micro-mechanics and Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) principles. At the scale of the Representative Elementary Volume (REV), damage is obtained by integrating crack densities over the unit sphere, which represents all possible crack plane orientations. The unit sphere is discretized into 42 integration points. The damage yield criterion is expressed at the microscopic scale: if a crack is in tension, crack growth is controlled by a mode I fracture mechanics criterion; if a crack is in compression, the shear stress that applies at its faces is projected on the directions considered in the numerical integration scheme, and cracks perpendicular to these projected force components grow according to a mode I fracture mechanics criterion. The projection of shear stresses into a set of tensile forces allows predicting the occurrence of wing cracks at the tips of pre-existing defects. We assume that all of the resulting mode I cracks do not interact, and we adopt a dilute homogenization scheme. A hardening law is introduced to account for subcritical crack propagation, and non-associated flow rules are adopted for damage and irreversible strains induced by residual crack displacements after unloading. The DEWCD model depends on only 6 constitutive parameters which all have a sound physical meaning and can be determined by direct measurements in the laboratory. The DEWCD model is calibrated and validated against triaxial compression tests performed on Bakken Shale. In order to highlight the advantages of the DEWCD model over previous anisotropic damage models proposed for rocks, we simulated: (a) A uniaxial tension followed by unloading and reloading in compression; and (b) Uniaxial compression loading cycles of increasing amplitude. We compared the results obtained with the DEWCD model with those obtained with a micro-mechanical model and with a CDM model, both calibrated against the same experimental dataset as the DEWCD model. The three models predict a non linear-stress/strain relationship and damage-induced anisotropy. The micro-mechanical model can capture unilateral effects. The CDM model can capture the occurrence of irreversible strains. The DEWCD model can capture both unilateral effects and irreversible strains. In addition, the DEWCD model can predict the apparent increase of strength and ductility in compression when the confinement increases and the increasing hysteresis on unloading-reloading paths as damage increases. The DEWCD model is the only of the three models tested that provides realistic values of yield stress and strength in tension and compression. This is a significant advancement in the theoretical modeling of brittle solids. Future work will be devoted to the prediction of crack coalescence and to the modeling of the material response with interacting micro-cracks.},

	abstract = {In situ gas extraction is the main measure adopted by mines to achieve mining safety standards. Coal permeability is significantly influenced by coal shrinkage during gas release. Based on effective stress and additional damage that resulted from gas extraction, a unique model was proposed to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of coal permeability within the effective influence zone. Calculation models for the conditions of one and two extracting boreholes were developed. A parametric study on both two models was also conducted, in which the effect of extraction time, extraction pressure, interval between two boreholes, and extraction pressure combination were qualitatively analyzed. The results demonstrated that with the increase of extraction time, gas extraction can result in less permeability reduction in the beginning but can enhance permeability. Coal permeability obviously increases when extraction time increases but gradually stabilizes, presenting “high middle and low around” surrounding the extracting borehole. Meanwhile, a decreasing relative amplification implies that permeability ratio does not increase linearly with the increase in extraction pressure. Both intervals between two extracting boreholes and different combinations of extraction pressure significantly influence the distribution of coal permeability. A comparison with some previous permeability studies was conducted to validate the proposed model, and the predicted evolution results matched the permeability testing data. In conclusion, the proposed model is consistent with the phenomenon in real engineering, and the model results can provide preliminary guidance for the design of extracting borehole distribution.},

The multistage hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells is commonly used stimulation technique to enhance the permeability of unconventional reservoirs in the oil and gas industry. However, a detailed study of applicability and design requirements for multistage fracturing of the EGS wells is required. In this work, we use “GeoFrac-3D” which is a 3D hydraulic fracture propagation model with advanced capabilities to simulate multistage fracturing of the horizontal wells. Numerical examples of multiple horizontal wells stimulation using conventional and modified zipper fracturing are presented the U.S. Department of Energy’s FORGE (Frontier Observatory for Geothermal Energy) well(s). Conditions for planar and nonplanar growth and potential network complexities are studied. The parameters controlling the fracture geometry, upward growth and fracture interactions are investigated. The results demonstrate the fracturing fluid density can plays a role in preventing upward growth of the fractures and can in fact, promote downward growth. Results also show that hydraulic fracture in both the conventional and modified zipper fracturing techniques can coalesce at their tips, which increases chances of wells connectivity through fracture-to-fracture interference. The modified zipper fracturing generates more complex fracture network, with potentially more surface area.},

The use of fiber optic sensors is increasing in the oil and gas industry but less so at geothermal sites. These sensors measure strain (or strain rate) with high spatial resolution ({\textasciitilde} 1 m) along the fiber and can survive extreme conditions. Here, we explore the information that these sensors may reveal in an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) system, which includes both low-frequency signals associated with fracture opening and high-frequency microseismic signals. As a test case, we use parameters from the FORGE site in Milford, Utah, which is expected to create a reservoir at a depth of roughly 2 km in a crystalline granite formation with temperatures of more than 175°C. The subsurface signals are simulated in two ways: 1) a massively parallel multi-physics code that is capable of modeling hydraulic stimulation of a reservoir with a pre-existing discrete fracture network, and 2) a parallelized seismic wave propagation code for high-frequency seismic signals created by microseismic activity. The objective is to understand how fracture geometry could be constrained with fiber optic sensors located both in the main borehole and in nearby monitoring boreholes, and how well microseismic events could be characterized in terms of locations and moment tensors.},

In this work, we use a fully 3D hydraulic/natural fracture simulator to study the complex interaction of hydraulic and natural fractures and their signatures on the pressure data. Our DFIT model consists of a hybrid boundary element and finite element method (BE-FEM) where stresses/deformations are solved using the displacement discontinuity method and the transport processes are modeled using finite element. Additionally, contact elements and Mohr-Coulomb criterion are used to capture the closed crack behavior. We use the model to shed light on the complex pressure data from FORGE and to provide a better estimate of the minimum in-situ stress and reservoir properties.},

The natural fractures in the FORGE reservoir are modeled as a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN). One DFN represents a single realization of a population that is only approximated through knowledge of its averaged properties. While each realization of the DFN created will share statistically equivalent properties, there will be local variations in individual fracture locations, sizes and orientations. In order to find representative (e.g., min, max, median, 95\% percentile, etc.) DFN realizations that are most useful for refined numerical simulation work, one hundred realizations of the DFN are generated and stimulated using the FracMan code. This code simplifies some of the underlying physics to enable rapid simulation of very large networks and is used as a screening tool to identify representative average and end-member DFN realizations for use by other modelers in more detailed studies of stimulation development.},

Massive CO2 injection into subsurface formation involves interactions among pressure and temperature change, chemical reactions, solute transport, and the mechanical response of the rock; this is a coupled thermal–hydraulic–mechanical–chemical (THMC) process. Numerical modeling of CO2 injection around the wellbore area can provide information such as changes in rock properties as well as stress and pressure changes, and this helps better predict injectivity evolution and leakage risk. In this paper, a fully coupled THMC model based on ﬁnite element methods is presented to analyze the transient stress, pressure, temperature and chemical solute concentration changes simultaneously around an injection well. To overcome these numerical oscillations in solving the transient advection–diffusion equations involved in the heat transfer and solute transport processes, we employ a stabilized ﬁnite element approach, the subgrid scale/gradient subgrid scale method (SGS/GSGS). A hypothetical numerical experiment on CO2 saturated water injection into a carbonate aquifer is conducted and preliminary results show that the fully coupled model can successfully analyze stress and pressure changes in the rock around a wellbore subjected to thermal and chemical effects.},

The responses of a number of randomly generated 2D fracture networks that represent a variety of reservoir characteristics are simulated with various injection-production well distances. We ﬁnd that ﬂow channeling, namely ﬂow concentration in cooled zones, is the inevitable fate of all the scenarios evaluated. We also identify a secondary geomechanical mechanism caused by the anisotropy in thermal stress that counteracts the primary mechanism of ﬂow channeling. This new mechanism tends, to some extent, to result in a more diffuse ﬂow distribution, although it is generally not strong enough to completely reverse ﬂow channeling. We ﬁnd that fracture intensity substantially affects the overall hydraulic impedance of the reservoir but increasing fracture intensity generally does not improve heat production performance. Increasing the injection-production well separation appears to be an effective means to prolong the production life of a reservoir.},

Although Jenike's approach has been successfully used for hoppers handling grains and other agricultural produces for decades, designing a hopper, ensuring reliable biomass handling is found to be challenging. This study aims to address this engineering problem with alternative constitutive material models concerning the flow behavior of bulk solids. Finite element modeling is an approach that allows for implementing different material models. Underlying constitutive theories of different material models assist in investigating the mechanical behavior of a particulate system, including the flow characteristics of ground biomass. This study demonstrates hopper flow models of two types of biomass, i.e., ground corn stover and Douglas fir, with the Mohr-Coulomb model, which is based on Jenike's approach, modified Cam-Clay model, and DruckerPrager/Cap model. The modeling results are compared with hopper flow experiments to highlights the advantages and shortfalls of each constitutive biomass flow model.},

Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the flow properties of the product red mud, for different moisture, in order to provide a mass flow in conical silos. Initially, the flow properties of red mud are determined by laboratory testing using the Jenike cell, and then the design of the silo hopper is performed using Jenike and Enstad theories, i. e. the minimum diameter and angle of inclination of the hopper are determined for each moisture level. In order to validate the theoretical results, experimental results were obtained in laboratory for red mud powder using silos with different hoppers.},

These design charts delineate mass-ﬂow and funnel-ﬂow behavior based on the hopper wall angle and a given set of material properties. The modeled system consists of hoppers with various wall angles and frictional, non-cohesive, spherical particles. The performance is assessed by measuring the particle residence times, particle velocities, and the extent of segregation during discharge. A Mass Flow Index (MFI) based on the velocity proﬁle data is used to quantitatively characterize the nature of the ﬂow pattern as mass-ﬂow, funnel-ﬂow, or some intermediate. The DEM predictions are generally in very good agreement with the Jenike design charts. The level of agreement shown here indicates that DEM cannot only reproduce the current estimates of hopper performance, but also provide additional insight into the ﬂow–such as the internal granular structure–that may be difﬁcult to obtain otherwise.},

This paper presents the characterization of the flow behavior of a widely used compressible biomass material (ground loblolly pine) using a combination of physical characterization and numerical simulation. An advanced hypoplastic model with implementation and validation in Abaqus VUMAT is adopted. A workflow is established to calibrate material parameters directly from index tests, an oedometer test, and a Schulze ring shear test, and indirectly from numerical simulations of those tests. The finite element simulation of axial shear tests and hopper flow tests using the calibrated hypoplastic model is shown to capture key flow attributes, such as the maximum shear stress in shear tests, as well as the mass flow rate and flow pattern in hopper. The results demonstrate that a subset of the laboratory tests needs to allow large strains for adequate characterization of compressible granular flow, and numerical models developed for non-compressible materials can accurately predict the flow behavior of compressible biomass material, even though strain magnitudes are not scaled correctly. This study provides a potent tool to decipher and resolve material handling upsets in biorefineries and other energy industries that utilize forest products.},

Our semi-implicit treatment is explicit in plasticity and preserves symmetry of force linearizations. We develop a novel regularization of the elastic part of the sand constitutive model that better mimics plasticity during the implicit solve to prevent numerical cohesion artifacts that would otherwise have occurred. Lastly, we develop an improved return mapping for sand plasticity that prevents volume gain artifacts in the traditional Drucker-Prager model.},

	abstract = {Fluid simulation, specifically the Material Point Method (MPM) based simulation, requires a large number of particles and a big grid size to create a realistic looking simulation. This paper explains what we can do to improve the performance of the simulation by using compute shader and the strategy behind it. Compute shader is a shader used for General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) programming, running in a separate pipeline than the rendering pipeline. Since the MPM simulation requires serialized code to update the values of the grid nodes and particles, it becomes a challenge to implement it into a parallelized code that can be run on the GPU with compute shader. First, we have to plan which part of the code that can be parallelized. We also have to translate the code into a GLSL program that doesn't have any C/C++ pointer and Object Oriented class. We then compare the simulation performance between the one running on CPU and the compute shader one, and see how much improvement is made by implementing it with compute shader.},

	abstract = {It has been 25 years since Sulsky and her coworkers developed the first version of the material point method (MPM): a quasi particle method to solve continuum mechanics problems. In the MPM, the continua are discretized by Lagrangian particles moving over a fixed Eulerian background grid. As a result, large deformation and contact can be treated effortlessly. Since then, many improved instances of the MPM have been developed and the MPM has found applications in many fields from geoengineering to movie industry. As the MPM has now been matured and a large body of literature on it exists, it is a good time to ponder and reflect on the developments of the method to date. To this end, this manuscript provides a concise introduction to the MPM, covering theory, implementation, and applications. All the algorithms required to have a working MPM implementation for the simulations of solids, fluids, and their interactions are provided. We have coded these algorithms in in-house open source programs and used them to study the performance of different MPM variants for large deformation solid mechanics problems. These problems exhibit large plastic deformation, fractures and contacts. Convergence of different MPMs (CPDI, GIMP, B-splines, total Lagrangian MPM, improved MPMs) are studied. Furthermore, MPM formulations for fluids/gases and heat conduction are also covered. Potential areas for improvement on the method have been identified. The paper is the first review of the MPM and presents a state of the art of the current MPM literature covering 339 references.},

	abstract = {The Material Point Method (MPM) has been shown to facilitate effective simulations of physically complex and topologically challenging materials, with a wealth of emerging applications in computational engineering and visual computing. Borne out of the extreme importance of regularity, MPM is given attractive parallelization opportunities on high-performance modern multiprocessors. Parallelization of MPM that fully leverages computing resources presents challenges that require exploring an extensive design-space for favorable data structures and algorithms. Unlike the conceptually simple CPU parallelization, where the coarse partition of tasks can be easily applied, it takes greater effort to reach the GPU hardware saturation due to its many-core SIMT architecture. In this paper we introduce methods for addressing the computational challenges of MPM and extending the capabilities of general simulation systems based on MPM, particularly concentrating on GPU optimization. In addition to our open-source high-performance framework, we also conduct performance analyses and benchmark experiments to compare against alternative design choices which may superficially appear to be reasonable, but can suffer from suboptimal performance in practice. Our explicit and fully implicit GPU MPM solvers are further equipped with a Moving Least Squares MPM heat solver and a novel sand constitutive model to enable fast simulations of a wide range of materials. We demonstrate that more than an order of magnitude performance improvement can be achieved with our GPU solvers. Practical high-resolution examples with up to ten million particles run in less than one minute per frame.},

Discrete element simulations provide unmatched levels of detail and generality, but prove excessively costly when applied to large scale systems. Continuum approaches are computationally tractable, but limited in applicability due to built-in modeling assumptions; e.g., models suitable for granular flows typically fail to capture clogging, bouncing and ballistic motion. In our hybrid approach, an oracle dynamically partitions the domain into continuum regions where safe, and discrete regions where necessary. The domains overlap along transition zones, where a Lagrangian dynamics mass-splitting coupling principle enforces agreement between the two simulation states. Enrichment and homogenization operations allow the partitions to evolve over time. This approach accurately and efficiently simulates scenarios that previously required an entirely discrete treatment.},

	abstract = {3D visual computing data are often spatially sparse. To exploit such sparsity, people have developed hierarchical sparse data structures, such as multi-level sparse voxel grids, particles, and 3D hash tables. However, developing and using these high-performance sparse data structures is challenging, due to their intrinsic complexity and overhead. We propose Taichi, a new data-oriented programming language for efficiently authoring, accessing, and maintaining such data structures. The language offers a high-level, data structure-agnostic interface for writing computation code. The user independently specifies the data structure. We provide several elementary components with different sparsity properties that can be arbitrarily composed to create a wide range of multi-level sparse data structures. This decoupling of data structures from computation makes it easy to experiment with different data structures without changing computation code, and allows users to write computation as if they are working with a dense array. Our compiler then uses the semantics of the data structure and index analysis to automatically optimize for locality, remove redundant operations for coherent accesses, maintain sparsity and memory allocations, and generate efficient parallel and vectorized instructions for CPUs and GPUs. Our approach yields competitive performance on common computational kernels such as stencil applications, neighbor lookups, and particle scattering. We demonstrate our language by implementing simulation, rendering, and vision tasks including a material point method simulation, finite element analysis, a multigrid Poisson solver for pressure projection, volumetric path tracing, and 3D convolution on sparse grids. Our computation-data structure decoupling allows us to quickly experiment with different data arrangements, and to develop high-performance data structures tailored for specific computational tasks. With 1{\textless}u{\textgreater}1{\textless}/u{\textgreater}0 th as many lines of code, we achieve 4.55× higher performance on average, compared to hand-optimized reference implementations.},

	abstract = {An important technical issue in the enhanced geothermal system (EGS) is the process of fracture shear and dilation, fracture network propagation and induced seismicity. EGS development requires an ability to reliably predict the fracture network’s permeability evolution. Laboratory and ﬁeld studies such as EGS Collab and Utah FORGE, and modeling simulations provide valuable lessons for successful commercial EGS design. In this work we present a modeling analysis of EGS Collab Testbed Experiment 1 (May 24, Stim-II ∼= 164 Notch) and interpret the stimulation results in relation to the creation of a fracture network. In doing so, we use an improved 3D discrete fracture network model coupled with a 3D thermo-poroelastic ﬁnite element model (FEM) which can consider fracture network evolution and induced seismicity. A dual-scale semi-deterministic fracture network is generated by combining data from image logs, foliations/micro-fractures, and core. The natural fracture properties (e.g., length and asperity) follow a stochastic distribution. The fracture network propagation under injection is considered by an ultrafast analytical approach. This coupled method allows for multiple seismic events to occur on and around a natural fracture. The uncertainties of seismic event clouds are better constrained using the energy conservation law. Numerical simulations show that the simulated fracture pressure proﬁles reasonably follow the trend observed in the ﬁeld test. The simulations support the concept that a natural fracture was propagated from the injection well connecting with the production well via intersection and coalescence with other natural fractures consistent with plausible ﬂow paths observed on the ﬁeld. The fracture propagation proﬁles from numerical modeling generally match the ﬁeld observation. The distribution of simulated microseismicity have good agreement with the ﬁeld-observed data.},

The proposed model is based on non-differentiable energy minimization for the dynamic deformation and fracture of the body coupled with mass balance of fluid flow within the hydro-fractures. We show that the use of a time-continuous fracture model, such as the present non-differentiable energy minimization model, is crucial for the numerical soundness and stability of the hydraulic fracture propagation algorithm. The reason is that time-discontinuous models give rise to spurious crack opening velocity fields which lead to unphysical solutions for the coupled fluid pressure field defined locally along the crack faces. A discontinuous Galerkin finite element formulation is implemented, in which every element edge in the mesh is a potential site of hydro-fracture initiation and propagation. Pre-existing natural fractures can be modelled with desirable flexibility by simply assigning different fracture properties to the element edges defining the natural fractures. Because the method allows for activation of cracks away from the evolving hydro-fracture, a search algorithm is proposed to identify the sub-set of cracked interfaces that form the domain on which the mass balance equation is defined and solved. Robustness of the proposed computational algorithm and its versatility in the study of hydraulic fracturing is shown by presenting several numerical simulations.},

Currently, traditional nodal force or crack surface traction release methods target the direct release of tractions on cracked surfaces within the current time/load step. An abrupt change from a system without cracks to another system with cracks may contribute to the instability issues. Specifically, because of broken meshes, discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods have an advantage over traditional continuous elements in naturally accommodating crack openings along DG interfaces across elements. To improve the convergence in nonlinear iterations during crack openings, we propose a relaxation scheme for DG formulations to gradually recover the traction-free condition on cracked surfaces. Furthermore, this DG-based relaxation scheme for crack openings in finite plastic media has been consistently formulated within the incomplete interior penalty DG framework. Finally, we have demonstrated a good performance of the proposed implicit DG formulation along with the DG relaxation scheme by successfully solving a nuclear fuel rod structural failure problem with multiple hydride crack openings and the Sandia Fracture Challenge benchmark.},

This paper conducted a review of available scientiﬁc literature, design standards and guidelines on energy piles performance within the framework of the IEA-ECES Annex 31. Main aspects covered were typical plant solutions, conﬁgurations of energy piles and their thermal response test performance, available analytical and numerical models with their main features and application in commercial software and design manuals. Four typical fundamental schemes of geothermal plant with energy piles were found, both suitable for cold and hot climate applications. Properly sized heat pump systems with energy piles were characterized with high overall system SCOP values higher than 4.5, while some case studies reported two times smaller SCOP values that illustrates the effect of proper design and sizing of such systems. The lack of speciﬁc heat extraction values which could be determined based on the climate and energy pile application show the need to develop general procedures for early stage energy pile sizing that would allow quick estimates of the heat extraction/rejection potential and system performance with reasonable accuracy for conceptual design. Most of available software is borehole oriented and will ﬁt for energy piles sizing if software supports variable ground surface temperature boundary conditions, which, however is not implemented in most of software packages. Expected software features to be implemented are water advection and multiregional surface boundary heat transfer.},

Hence, we applied a life-cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental performance of ATES−ISB, which is also compared with the conventional heating and cooling system plus ISB alone (CHC + ISB). Energy supply via electricity is revealed as the primary cause of the environmental impacts, contributing 61.26\% impacts of ATES−ISB and 72.91\% impacts of CHC + ISB. Speciﬁcally, electricity is responsible for over 95\% of water use, global warming potential, acidiﬁcation potential, and respiratory inorganics, whereas the production of the biological medium for bioremediation causes more than 85\% of the eco- and human toxicity impacts in both cases. The overall environmental impact of ATES−ISB is two times smaller than that of CHC + ISB. Sensitivity analysis conﬁrms the importance of electricity consumption and electron donor production to the environmental impacts in both energy supply and bioremediation. Thus, future studies and practical applications seeking possible optimization of the environmental performances of ATES−ISB are recommended to focus more on these two essential elements, e.g., electricity and electron donor, and their related parameters. With the comprehensive LCA, insight is obtained for better characterizing the crucial factors as well as the relevant direction for future optimization research of the ATES− ISB system.},

	abstract = {Fracture propagation coupled with fluid flow in porous media has very important applications in fracking in oil and gas reservoirs, corrosion in ceramics, and degradation of human bones. Modeling fracture failure in porous media governed by the coupled solid and fluid field equations is challenging and time-consuming. This paper extends discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods to model crack openings in porous media through exploiting an easy construction of interfaces for potential crack paths by locally breaking continuous elements. Consequently, a finite element mesh for fracture apertures is completely and gracefully constructed using DG interface objects as well as the definitions of jumps of displacements across the DG interfaces defined for bulk matrices. Furthermore, rigid cohesive laws often adopted for crack openings can be naturally implemented in DG formulations without introducing artificial stiffness, which may eventually improve the performance for implicit formulations in handling crack openings in porous media. In this work, we perform a consistent, fully implicit, and fully coupled hybrid DG/continuous finite element formulation for three field equations including the solid, bulk fluid, and fluid in fracture apertures resulting from crack openings. We verify our DG formulation and implementation using the Khristianovich-Geertsma-DeKlerk analytical solutions. Finally, we further demonstrate a good performance of the proposed DG method by modeling fracking in an oil reservoir containing two nature fractures.},

	abstract = {Field-scale modeling of hydraulic fracture development in formations containing preexisting fractures is a time-consuming task for XFEM-based numerical models. Because the costly solving of large-scale linear equation systems has to be performed for many times during two types of iteration processes of solving the ﬂuid-solid coupling equations and determining the contact status between frictional fracture surfaces. In view of this challenge, a reduction technique is proposed in a tightly coupled model in which the equilibrium and ﬂow continuity equations are solved simultaneously by the Newton-Raphson method. By retaining the enriched degrees of freedom (DOFs) and removing the standard DOFs which have no contribution to fracture opening, the dimensions of linear equation systems to be solved for both the ﬂuid-solid coupling iteration and the nonlinear contact iteration can be signiﬁcantly reduced. In the coupled model, the continuity of pressure and the mass balance at intersections of hydro-fractures are automatically achieved by sharing a common ﬂuid node. The contact behavior of frictional fractures is modeled using the penalty method within the framework of plasticity theory of friction. Moreover, the extended Renshaw and Pollard criterion is utilized to predict whether a hydro-fracture will propagate across the frictional fracture. Simulation results indicate that the reduction technique can signiﬁcantly accelerate the simulation without worsening the convergence or losing the computational accuracy for both types of iterations, and the acceleration effect becomes more remarkable as the problem scale increases. The great advantages of XFEM as well as the computational efﬁciency make the proposed method an attractive tool for engineering design of hydraulic fracturing treatments.},

Overall, interactions between natural fractures and hydraulic fractures pose more challenges in the fracturing design and its execution. Investigation and understanding of their interaction are crucial in achieving successful fracture treatments in formations with pre-existing natural fracture network. In this paper, we will review the numerical works that have been done in the last decade to model opening of natural fractures during hydraulic fracturing, focusing especially on mechanical models that address propagation of hydraulic fractures in naturally fractures reservoirs. Linear elastic fracture mechanics, cohesive element methods and continuum damage mechanics techniques utilized to understand interaction of hydraulic fractures with natural fractures are discussed here based on their capability to reproduce experimental results and ﬁeld observations.},

	abstract = {Monitoring is a crucial aspect of geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration risk management. Eﬀective monitoring is critical to ensure CO2 is safely and permanently stored throughout the life-cycle of a geologic CO2 sequestration project. Eﬀective monitoring involves deciding: (i) where is the optimal location to place the monitoring well(s), and (ii) what type of data (pressure, temperature, CO2 saturation, etc.) should be measured taking into consideration the uncertainties at geologic sequestration sites. We have developed a ﬁltering-based data assimilation procedure to design eﬀective monitoring approaches. To reduce the computational cost of the ﬁltering-based data assimilation process, a machine-learning algorithm: Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines is used to derive computationally eﬃcient reduced order models from results of full-physics numerical simulations of CO2 injection in saline aquifer and subsequent multi-phase ﬂuid ﬂow. We use example scenarios of CO2 leakage through legacy wellbore and demonstrate a monitoring strategy can be selected with the aim of reducing uncertainty in metrics related to CO2 leakage. We demonstrate the proposed framework with two synthetic examples: a simple validation case and a more complicated case including multiple monitoring wells. The examples demonstrate that the proposed approach can be eﬀective in developing monitoring approaches that take into consideration uncertainties.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a machine learning assisted computational workﬂow to optimize a CO2-WAG project considering both hydrocarbon recovery and CO2 sequestration efﬁcacies. A compositional ﬁeld-scaled numerical simulation model is structured to investigate the ﬂuid ﬂow dynamics of an on-going CO2EOR project in the Farnsworth Unit (Texas, US). Artiﬁcial-neural-network (ANN) based proxy models are trained to predict time-series project responses including hydrocarbon production, CO2 storage and reservoir pressure data. The outputs of the proxy model not only serve for evaluating the objective function but also provide signiﬁcant physical and economic constraints to the optimization processes. In this work, the objective function considers both the oil recovery and CO2 sequestration volume. Moreover, the project net present values (NPV) and reservoir pressure are employed to screen the optimum solutions. The proposed optimization workﬂow couples the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and the ANN proxies to maximize the prescribed objective function. The results of this work indicate that the presented workﬂow is a more robust approach to co-optimize the CO2-EOR projects. Results show that the optimized case can store about 94\% of the purchased CO2 within Farnsworth Unit. Comparing to the baseline case, the CO2 storage amount of the found optimal case increases by 21.69\%, and the oil production improves 8.74\%. More importantly, the improvements in CO2 storage and hydrocarbon recovery lead to 8.74\% greater project NPV and 19.79\% higher overall objective function value, which conﬁrms the success of the developed co-optimization approach for CO2 sequestration and oil recovery. The lessons and experiences earned from this work provides signiﬁcant insights into the decision-making process of similar CO2-EOR cases.},

The proposed optimization protocol considers various objectives, including oil recovery and CO2 storage volume. Expert MLNN systems are trained and employed as surrogate models of the high-fidelity compositional simulator in the optimization workflow. When multiple objective functions are considered, two approaches are employed to treat the objectives: the weighted sum method and the Pareto-front-based scheme. A field-scale implementation focusing on tertiary recovery in the Morrow B formation at Farnsworth Unit (FWU) is presented. The developed Pareto-optimal solutions indicate the maximal available oil production can be 1.64 × 107 barrels and maximal carbon storage can achieve 2.35 × 107 tons. Trade-offs factor is defined to divide the constructed Pareto front into 4 sections with the trade-off factors’ value ranges from 0.35 to 49.9. This work also compares the optimum solution found by the aggregative objective function and the solution repository covered by the Pareto front that considers the physical and operational constraints and reduces uncertainties involved by the multi-objective optimization process. Our comparison indicates multiple solutions exist to satisfy the objective criteria of the WAG design, and these results cannot be found using the traditional weighted sum method. The Pareto front solution can provide more options for project designers, but decisions regarding necessary trade-offs must be made using the solution repository to balance the project economics and CO2 storage amount.},

This paper aims to introduce a filtering concept for evaluation and optimization of the feasibility and energy productivity for hydrothermal doublet systems. It also provides an intensive parametric study for several constraining geological- and engineering-related parameters which are selected based on limited available data at an early stage of geothermal projects. A new code, called TIGER, is introduced for modelling coupled thermal-hydro processes in porous media. Two reservoir conditions are studied and compared: a) homogeneous and b) fractured reservoirs. The effects of different fracture orientations and configurations are considered. For feasible and sustainable production over 30 years in the case of the homogeneous reservoir, reservoir permeabilities {\textgreater}5 × 10−14 m2 and sufficient reservoir thickness are required. While reservoir thickness is directly proportional to reservoir performance, increasing reservoir permeability will after a certain threshold reduce reservoir performance due to thermal break-through. To improve reasonably fluid circulation, either a direct connection of wells via a common fracture or indirect connection through fractures network is necessary. However, fast thermal break-through is a common thread, especially for well distances {\textless}400 m and high transmissive fractures, and has to be considered during the design of reservoir operation. This study supplies several self-described and contour-style charts, as guidelines, for project developers and decision-makers to initially evaluate sustainable geothermal potentials in different projects.},

The sensitivities of key model (i.e. the drag model) and modeling parameters (particle–particle restitution coefﬁcient, normal particle–wall restitution coefﬁcient, and tangential particle–wall restitution coefﬁcient) on the predictions have been tested systematically. Experimental results of Richtberg et al. [Powder Technol. 2005, 155(2), 145–152] and Yin et al. [Chem. Eng.

The results show that the Gidaspow drag model displays better agreement with both the axial proﬁles of pressure drop and the radial distributions of particle volume fraction. Compared with the perfectly elastic particle collision (ep = 1.0), the non-ideal particle–particle interaction could get more reasonable prediction results. The particle–wall restitution coefﬁcient has somewhat of an effect on the simulated gas–solid ﬂow behaviors in the risers. However, no critical changes of simulated ﬂow characteristic in the trends of pressure drop and solid volume fraction distribution have been found. Based on the comparison of simulation results with experiments, a suitable model (i.e., Gidaspow drag model) and a group of modeling parameters, namely a particle–particle restitution coefﬁcient (ep = 0.9), a normal particle–wall restitution coefﬁcient (ewn = 0.1) and a free-slip boundary condition (i.e. the tangential particle–wall restitution coefﬁcient, ewτ = 1.0) for modeling the hydrodynamic behavior in the DHFCDB riser were determined and veriﬁed.},

Effects of drag, lift, gravity, buoyancy, pressure gradient, shear stress terms, thermophoresis and Brownian forces on particles movements are considered. Furthermore, effects of various design parameters on the heat transfer rate and deposition of particles such as Rayleigh number (104 6 Ra 6 107) as well as orientation and number of the HACs are investigated. Our simulations indicate that thermophoretic force can signiﬁcantly affect the distribution of particles of dp ¼ 1 lm diameter.

Moreover, it was observed that by increasing number of the HACs and changing orientation of the HACs from vertical to horizontal, deposition rate of the solid particles increases signiﬁcantly.},

Traditionally, Waste-to-Energy(WtE) is mostly associated with incineration, but now, with the emergence of the bioeconomy, it embraces a broader definition comprising any processing technique that can generate electricity/heat or produce a waste-derived fuel. Under the ambit of the circular economy many nations are looking for, additional effort must be made to be sure of acquiring the most updated information and paving a sustainable path for managing MSW in such a frame. In this regard, we have undertaken a critical review of various technologies, with their updated progress, involved in the exploitation of MSW as a renewable resource, along with the critical advantages and limitations on energy and material cycling for sustainable MSW management. Incineration, the most widely used method, is nowadays difficult to further apply due to its dubious reputation and social opposition. Meanwhile, to address the organic fraction of MSW which currently is mostly unrecycled and causes disposal issues, the biological approach presents an attractive option. The new emphasis of bioeconomy leads us to understand how environmental biotechnologies should be better connected/integrated for more sustainable MSW management. This article is concluded with advances of future prospects, which can serve as a timely reminder to encourage competent authorities/researchers to work towards further improvement of the present MSW management system.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work is to simulate mode II multi-scale fracture propagation in shale by coupling a continuum 
anisotropic damage model with a Cohesive Zone Model (CZM). The Continuum Damage Mechanics – based Differential Stress 
Induced Damage (DSID) model is used to represent micro-scale crack evolution. DSID parameters were calibrated against pre-peak 
points of stress/strain curves obtained experimentally during triaxial compression tests performed in Bakken shale. A bilinear CZM 
is employed to represent macroscale fracture propagation. We calculated the effective shear modulus of a continuum that contained 
a distribution of parallel cracks according to the DSID model (which does not account for crack interactions) and according to 
Kachanov’s micromechanical model (which accounts for crack interactions). Simulations confirmed that above a crack density or 
damage of 0.3, crack interactions could not be ignored, and we used that threshold to define the transition between continuum 
damage propagation and discrete fracture propagation and subsequently, to calibrate the shear cohesive strength of the CZM. The 
CZM cohesive energy release rate was determined by calibrating a numerical model of triaxial compression test against 
experimental data obtained on Bakken shale. The cylindrical sample was modeled with a CZM to pre-define an inclined cohesive 
fracture, and the DSID model was assigned to the surrounding elements. We used our calibrated CZM-DSID model to simulate a 
biaxial compression test in plane strain. Results clearly show that the proposed modeling strategy not only allows simulating the 
advancement of macro-fracture tips, but also captures the inception and growth of micro-cracks that form damaged zones, as well 
as the transition between smeared damage and discrete fracture.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work is to model the influence of shear stresses induced by viscous fluid flow on wellbore 
spalling. We simulated a drop of stress and pore pressure at the wall of a meter-scale borehole with a plane strain 
Finite Element model. The rock mass was modeled as a jointed continuum. Block sliding was predicted from the 
tangential displacements in the joint after the shear failure criterion was reached. Simulations show that: (1) Higher 
far field stresses induce more normal stress in the joints, which prevents the occurrence of shear plastic strains in the 
joints and reduces block sliding at the wall; (2) Shear stresses and consequent shear plastic strains that are induced by 
viscous fluid flow in the joints are higher for higher fluid viscosities, and decrease over time as the blocks on each 
side of the joint slide on each other; (3) In joints that are in contact with the borehole, a change of one order of 
magnitude in the fluid viscosity results in a change in joint shear stress by a factor of 2. Results suggest that if 
drainage had been simulated over a longer period of time or for a smaller borehole diameter, the failure criterion 
would have been reached on a larger zone around the borehole, which could have a critical impact on the risk of 
borehole spalling. The numerical approach proposed in this work is expected to be useful to recommend wellbore 
operation modes so as to avoid excessive spalling and clogging.},

Formulae for estimating the mean and standard deviation of the characteristic fracture size are developed by considering the number of intersections between the fractures and the boreholes.

Challenges in theoretical and numerical modeling include the distinction between tensile and compressive fracture propagation modes, mesh dependency during softening, and lack of convergence when several critical points are expected on the stress/strain curve. To overcome these issues, we formulate a nonlocal micromechanics based anisotropic damage model. A dilute homogenization scheme is adopted for calculating the deformation energy of the Representative Elementary Volume due to the displacement jumps at open and closed micro-cracks. Tension (respectively compression) damage criteria are expressed in terms of non-local equivalent strains defined in terms of positive principal strains (respectively deviatoric strains). Constitutive parameters are calibrated against published experimental data for concrete and shale. We employ the arc-length control method to solve boundary-value problems with the finite element package OOFEM: the algorithm allows capturing softening, snap back and snap through. We simulate the development of the compression damage zone around a cavity under various stress levels at the wall and far field, and the softening behavior consequent to tensile fracture propagation during a three-point bending test. No mesh dependency is noted during softening as long as micro-cracks do not interact.},

	abstract = {We propose a numerical method that couples a cohesive zone model (CZM) and a finite element-based continuum damage mechanics (CDM) model. The CZM represents a mode II macro-fracture, and CDM finite elements (FE) represent the damage zone of the CZM. The coupled CZM/CDM model can capture the flow of energy that takes place between the bulk material that forms the matrix and the macroscopic fracture surfaces. The CDM model, which does not account for micro-crack interaction, is calibrated against triaxial compression tests performed on Bakken shale, so as to reproduce the stress/strain curve before the failure peak. Based on a comparison with Kachanov's micro-mechanical model, we confirm that the critical micro-crack density value equal to 0.3 reflects the point at which crack interaction cannot be neglected. The CZM is assigned a pure mode II cohesive law that accounts for the dependence of the shear strength and energy release rate on confining pressure. The cohesive shear strength of the CZM is calibrated by calculating the shear stress necessary to reach a CDM damage of 0.3 during a direct shear test. We find that the shear cohesive strength of the CZM depends linearly on the confining pressure. Triaxial compression tests are simulated, in which the shale sample is modeled as an FE CDM continuum that contains a predefined thin cohesive zone representing the idealized shear fracture plane. The shear energy release rate of the CZM is fitted in order to match to the post-peak stress/strain curves obtained during experimental tests performed on Bakken shale. We find that the energy release rate depends linearly on the shear cohesive strength. We then use the calibrated shale rheology to simulate the propagation of a meter-scale mode II fracture. Under low confining pressure, the macroscopic crack (CZM) and its damaged zone (CDM) propagate simultaneously (i.e., during the same loading increments). Under high confining pressure, the fracture propagates in slip-friction, that is, the debonding of the cohesive zone alternates with the propagation of continuum damage. The computational method is applicable to a range of geological injection problems including hydraulic fracturing and fluid storage and should be further enhanced by the addition of mode I and mixed mode (I+II+III) propagation.

This study proposes a new methodology to determine the equivalent elastic properties of shale formations that uses the weak patches stiffness model and fracture mechanics theory to theoretically consider both BP- and NF-induced anisotropy. First, a series of uniaxial compression tests for Longmaxi shale demonstrates that its apparent elastic modulus ranges from 14.9 to 18.8GPa. Then, by collecting experimental data and performing a Monte–Carlo simulation method, the NF network is built within the target 3D shale formation, and the equivalent elastic modulus values along a given wellbore wall are estimated. The results reveal that the elastic parameters of shale formations exhibit high directional dependency associated with the presence of BPs and NFs; a higher NF density is also found to lower the BP-induced anisotropy. Wider application of Monte–Carlo simulations in future studies is recommended to calculate the deformation issues of large-scale numerical petroleum engineering modeling when considering the influence of NFs.},

	abstract = {The discrete damage model presented in this paper accounts for 42 non-interacting crack microplanes directions. At the scale of the representative volume element, the free enthalpy is the sum of the elastic energy stored in the non-damaged bulk material and in the displacement jumps at crack faces. Closed cracks propagate in the pure mode II, whereas open cracks propagate in the mixed mode (I/II). The elastic domain is at the intersection of the yield surfaces of the activated crack families, and thus describes a non-smooth surface. In order to solve for the 42 crack densities, a Closest Point Projection algorithm is adopted locally. The representative volume element inelastic strain is calculated iteratively using the Newton–Raphson method. The proposed damage model was rigorously calibrated for both compressive and tensile stress paths. Finite element method simulations of triaxial compression tests showed that the transition between brittle and ductile behavior at increasing confining pressure can be captured. The cracks’ density, orientation, and location predicted in the simulations are in agreement with experimental observations made during compression and tension tests, and accurately show the difference between tensile and compressive strength. Plane stress tension tests simulated for a fiber-reinforced brittle material also demonstrated that the model can be used to interpret crack patterns, design composite structures and recommend reparation techniques for structural elements subjected to multiple damage mechanisms.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the theoretical formulation and numerical implementation of an anisotropic damage model for materials with intrinsic transverse isotropy. Crack initiation and propagation are modeled by phenomenological damage evolution laws, controlled by four equivalent strain measures. The latter are constructed so as to distinguish the mechanical response of the material in tension and compression, along the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane and within the bedding plane. To avoid mesh dependency induced by softening, equivalent strains are replaced by nonlocal counterparts, defined as weighted averages over a neighborhood scaled by two internal length parameters. Finite Element equations are solved with a normal plane arc length control algorithm, which allows passing limit points in case of snap back or snap through. The model is calibrated against triaxial compression tests performed on shale, for different confinements and loading orientations relative to the bedding plane. Gauss point simulations confirm that the model successfully captures the variation of uniaxial tensile strength with respect to the bedding orientation. Finite Element simulations of three-point bending tests and compression splitting tests show that nonlocal enhancement indeed avoids mesh dependency, and that the axial and transverse dimensions of the damage process zone are scaled by the two characteristic lengths. Results further show that the damage process zone is direction dependent both in tension and compression. The model can be used for any type of textured brittle material; it allows representing several concurrent damage mechanisms in the macroscopic response and interpreting the failure mechanisms that control the damage process zone.},

This work presents the characterization of the mechanical behavior of ground loblolly pine by combining physical experiments and numerical simulations. A modified Drucker-Prager/Cap (MDPC) model enhanced with density dependence is used for finite element modeling. Cyclic oedometer tests with increased magnitude of compressive stress and Schulze ring shear tests are performed to characterize material compressibility and shear behavior. The laboratory tests yield stress-strain curves, density-stress curves and Mohr-Coulomb shear envelopes, which are then used directly and indirectly to calibrate elasticity, as well as cap and shear failure parameters of the MDPC model. Full size 3D Schulze ring shear tests are modeled in Abaqus with calibrated model parameters, and the simulated Mohr-Coulomb envelops match well against experimental results, indicating the stress state within the shear band of the ring shear test is close to triaxial compression. The modeling results also show the MDPC model does not predict dilation followed by constant volume as observed by experiments. The mechanical behavior derived from the experiments and the methodology proposed for model calibration and stress state characterization provide a foundation for studying biomass flow behavior in material feeding and handling equipment.},

	abstract = {The design of efficient material-handling systems for milled lignocellulosic biomass is challenging due to their complex particle morphologies and frictional interactions. Computational modeling, including the discrete element method (DEM) and continuum-based finite-element/volume methods, may offer scientific insight and predictive capabilities for the flow of milled biomass in hoppers and feeders. This article (Part II) presents a review of current state-of-the-art continuum models for the flow of milled biomass, whereas DEM models are reviewed in a companion article (Part I). Advances of numerical methods to solve the global governing equations are discussed first, followed by a comprehensive review of constitutive models for granular materials, including Drucker–Prager, hypoplastic, Cambridge-type, inertial-rheology, and nonlocal granular fluidity models. Specifically, we provide in-depth discussion on the suitability of those models for milled lignocellulosic biomass materials in terms of nonlinear elasticity, dependence of flow strength on pressure, density and shear rate, and compaction (dilation) associated with hardening (softening). Our study shows that, despite the recent advances in continuum granular flow modeling, the most suitable constitutive models still need further development to account for material parametrization, multiflow regimes, and multiscale behavior before they can be reliably used to optimize the design and operation of biomass handling systems.},

This paper reviews the state-of-the-art discrete element methods (DEM) for the flow of milled biomass (Part I), accompanied by a comprehensive review on continuum-based computational models (Part II). The present review on DEM is primarily focused on the features and suitability of various particle shape models for different types of milled biomass because particle shape is the predominant attribute controlling the flow behavior of complex-shaped granular material. The general strengths and weaknesses in the applicability of those models for the milled biomass modeling are summarized. In particular, comments are provided to balance the numerical model capabilities and the computational cost for the development of DEM models. To our best knowledge, this is the first-of-its-kind review on DEM specifically for biomass. Our study indicates that the current DEM models require further development, calibration, and validation based on a deep understanding of biomass particle contact mechanics and experimental data support before they can be reliably used for predictive simulations in handling and feeding systems.},

Yet, the presence of obstacles can be highly disruptive to the root system. We grew wheat seedlings in sealed petri dishes without obstacle and in custom 3D-printed rhizoboxes containing obstacles. Time-lapse photography was used to reconstruct the wheat root morphology network. We used the reconstructed wheat root network without obstacle to calibrate an RSA model implemented in the R-SWMS software. The root network with obstacles allowed calibrating the parameters of a new function that models the influence of rigid obstacles on wheat root growth. Experimental results show that the presence of a rigid obstacle does not affect the growth rate of the wheat root axes, but that it does influence the root trajectory after the main axis has passed the obstacle. The growth recovery time, i.e. the time for the main root axis to recover its geotropism-driven growth, is proportional to the time during which the main axis grows along the obstacle. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between experimental and numerical results show that the proposed model successfully simulates wheat RSA growth around obstacles. Our results suggest that wheat roots follow patterns that could inspire the design of adaptive engineering flow networks.},

	abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been identiﬁed as an urgent, strategic and essential approach to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and mitigate the severe consequences of climate change. CO2 storage is the last step in the CCS chain and can be implemented mainly through oceanic and underground geological sequestration, and mineral carbonation. This review paper aims to provide state-of-the-art developments in CO2 storage. The review initially discussed the potential options for CO2 storage by highlighting the present status, current challenges and uncertainties associated with further deployment of established approaches (such as storage in saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas reservoirs) and feasibility demonstration of relatively newer storage concepts (such as hydrate storage and CO2-based enhanced geothermal systems). The second part of the review outlined the critical criteria that are necessary for storage site selection, including geological, geothermal, geohazards, hydrodynamic, basin maturity, and economic, societal and environmental factors. In the third section, the focus was on identiﬁcation of CO2 behaviour within the reservoir during and after injection, namely injection-induced seismicity, potential leakage pathways, and long-term containment complexities associated with CO2-brine-rock interaction. In addition, a detailed review on storage capacity estimation methods based on diﬀerent geological media and trapping mechanisms was provided. Finally, an overview of major CO2 storage projects, including their overall outcomes, were outlined. This review indicates that although CO2 storage is a technically proven strategy, the discussed challenges need to be addressed in order to accelerate the deployment of the technology. In addition, beside the necessity of techno-economic aspects, public acceptance of CO2 storage plays a central role in technology deployment, and the current ethical mechanisms need to be further improved.},

	abstract = {Since the Industrial Revolution, anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have grown exponentially, accumulating in the atmosphere and leading to global warming. According to the IPCC (IPCC Special Report, 2018), atmospheric warming should be {\textless}2◦C to avoid the most serious consequences associated with climate change. This goal may be achieved in part by reducing CO2 emissions, together with capturing and sequestering CO2 from point sources. The most mature storage technique is sequestration in deep saline aquifers. In addition, CO2 can be mineralized and sequestered in solid form by various techniques, i.e., ex-situ, surﬁcial and in situ mineralization. Ex situ and surﬁcial approaches may produce valuable products while mitigating environmental hazards. In-situ mineralization uses ultramaﬁc and maﬁc geological formations for permanent, solid storage. In addition, the IPCC portfolio that limits warming to {\textless}2◦C by 2100 includes avoiding CO2 emissions and removal of CO2 from air. Regardless of the speciﬁc mix of approaches, it will be essential to permanently sequester about 10 billion tons of CO2 per year by mid-century, and roughly twice that amount each year by 2100. Maximizing the potential of technologies for CO2 removal from air and CO2 storage will help to meet global climate goals. The research agenda published by National Academies of Sciences Engineering Medicine (2019) calls for roughly \$1 billion over a 10–20 years time period to advance the deployment of CO2 sequestration in deep sedimentary reservoirs at the GtCO2/yr scale and develop CO2 mineralization at the MtCO2/yr scale. This would lead to a deeper understanding of the reservoir characteristics from the nano- to kilometer scale, some of which may include the distribution of the reaction products, the reaction rate of the minerals, the permeability evolution, the pressure build-up in the reservoir, the large-scale impact of chemicophysical processes leading to clogging or cracking, the effects of potential geochemical contamination, etc. This overview presents the advantages, drawbacks, costs, and CO2 storage potential of each technique, the current and future projects in this domain, and potential sequestration options in geologic formations around the world.},

	abstract = {The emissions of greenhouse gases, especially CO2, have been identified as the main contributor for global warming and climate change. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is considered to be the most promising strategy to mitigate the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This review aims to provide the latest developments of CO2 storage from the perspective of improving safety and economics. The mechanisms and strategies of CO2 storage, focusing on their characteristics and current status, are discussed firstly. In the second section, the strategies for assessing and ensuring the security of CO2 storage operations, including the risks assessment approach and monitoring technology associated with CO2 storage, are outlined. In addition, the engineering methods to accelerate CO2 dissolution and mineral carbonation for fixing the mobile CO2 are also compared within the second section. The third part focuses on the strategies for improving economics of CO2 storage operations, namely enhanced industrial production with CO2 storage to generate additional profit, and co-injection of CO2 with impurities to reduce the cost. Moreover, the role of multiple CCS technologies and their distribution on the mitigation of CO2 emissions in the future are summarized. This review demonstrates that CO2 storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs could play an important role in reducing CO2 emission in the near future and CO2 storage in saline aquifers may make the biggest contribution due to its huge storage capacity. Comparing the various available strategies, CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) operations are supposed to play the most important role for CO2 mitigation in the next few years, followed by CO2-enhanced gas recovery (CO2-EGR). The direct mineralization of flue gas by coal fly ash and the pH swing mineralization would be the most promising technology for the mineral sequestration of CO2. Furthermore, by accelerating the deployment of CCS projects on large scale, the government can also play its role in reducing the CO2 emissions.},

Among others, water-bearing reservoirs in former hydrocarbon formations show favorable storage conditions for HT-ATES locations. This study characterizes these reservoirs in the Upper Rhine Graben (URG) and quantifies their heat storage potential numerically. Assuming a doublet system with seasonal injection and production cycles, injection at 140 °C in a typical 70 °C reservoir leads to an annual storage capacity of up to 12 GWh and significant recovery efficiencies increasing up to 82\% after ten years of operation. Our numerical modeling-based sensitivity analysis of operational conditions identifies the specific underground conditions as well as drilling configuration (horizontal/vertical) as the most influencing parameters. With about 90\% of the investigated reservoirs in the URG transferable into HT-ATES, our analyses reveal a large storage potential of these well-explored oil fields. In summary, it points to a total storage capacity in depleted oil reservoirs of approximately 10 TWh a−1, which is a considerable portion of the thermal energy needs in this area.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a numerical method is proposed to simulate multi-scale fracture propagation driven by ﬂuid injection in transversely isotropic porous media. Intrinsic anisotropy is accounted for at the continuum scale, by using a damage model in which two equivalent strains are deﬁned to distinguish mechanical behavior in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the layer. Nonlocal equivalent strains are calculated by integration and are directly introduced in the damage evolution law. When the weighted damage exceeds a certain threshold, the transition from continuum damage to cohesive fracture is performed by dynamically inserting cohesive segments. Diffusion equations are used to model ﬂuid ﬂow inside the porous matrix and within the macro-fracture, in which conductivity is obtained by Darcy’s law and the cubic law, respectively. In the fractured elements, the displacement and pore pressure ﬁelds are discretized by using the XFEM technique. Interpolation on fracture elements is enriched with jump functions for displacements and with level set-based distance functions for ﬂuid pressure, which ensures that displacements are discontinuous across the fracture, but that the pressure ﬁeld remains continuous. After spatial and temporal discretization, the model is implemented in a Matlab code. Simulations are carried out in plane strain. The results validate the formulation and implementation of the proposed model and further demonstrate that it can account for material and stress anisotropy.},

The crack propagation is modeled using a combination of continuous damage and XFEM. The poroelastic problem in the first stage of cracking is modeled using a poro-damage model, where the permeability is linked to the damage coefficient. Once the crack is modeled using XFEM, a hydraulic mesh is automatically generated on the fracture surface with the possibility of including features such as drains. The pressure is computed on the hydraulic mesh taking into account the crack opening computed with the structural model and the different types of flow in a crack: laminar or turbulent, parallel or non-parallel. The pressure computed with the hydraulic mesh is transferred to the structural mesh to recompute the structural response. This procedure, iterated until convergence, can predict hydraulic fracturing taking into account complex flows. A validation example on a wedge-splitting specimen is presented.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a fully coupled hydro-mechanical model is presented for the study of multizone hydraulic fracturing. The momentum balance equation of the bulk together with the mass balance and momentum balance equation of the fluid phase are employed in order to derive the hydro-mechanical coupled system of governing equations of the porous media known as the \$\$(\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{u\}\} - p)\$\$(u-p)formulation. The hydro-fracture inflow is modeled based on the Darcy law, where the fracture permeability is determined by using the cubic law. Provisions are made for the plausible closure as well as the frictional resistance of the fracture edges in the solid phase by means of Kuhn–Tucker inequalities embedded in an X-FEM penalty method. In addition, for the fluid phase, the zero leak-off constrain is imposed through the application of the large time increment-based contact algorithm in the case of crack closure. The cohesive crack model is employed to account for the nonlinear fracturing process at the hydro-fracture tips. Multiple crack growth patterns are determined by means of energy based cohesive stress functions. Based on the X-FEM, the strong discontinuities in the displacement field due to fracture opening as well as the weak discontinuities within the pressure field due to leak-off flow are incorporated by using the Heaviside and modified level-set enrichment functions, respectively. A consistent computational algorithm is proposed for the determination of the fracturing fluid flow distribution across the existing perforations. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed X-FEM framework in the study of multizone hydraulic fracturing treatments through saturated porous media. The results appear to accord with the field observations reporting numerous failed attempts of multistage multizone fracturing treatments, which provide a great insight into the complexities encountered in practice.},

The technique allows modeling the discontinuities independent of the ﬁnite element mesh by introducing additional DOFs. The coupled equilibrium and ﬂow continuity equations are solved using a staggered Newton solution strategy, and an algorithm is proposed on the basis of ﬁxed-point iteration concept to impose the ﬂow condition at the hydro-fracture mouth. The cohesive crack model is employed to introduce the nonlinear fracturing process occurring ahead of the hydro-fracture tip. Frictional contact is modeled along the natural fault using the penalty method within the framework of plasticity theory of friction. Moreover, an experimental investigation is carried out to perform the hydraulic fracturing experimental test in fractured media under plane strain condition.

The well-known u − p formulation is employed in order to obtain the fully coupled set of governing equations. Natural faults are modeled for both opening and closure modes where the fluid inflow and contact conditions are considered at the interface, respectively. The Darcy law is employed in conjunction with an aperture dependent permeability for the fracture channel to describe the interfacial inflow. The contact constraints of both the solid and fluid phases are imposed using the Penalty method. The Heaviside and modified ramp enrichment functions are introduced to model the required strong and weak discontinuities in the displacement and pressure fields, respectively. Furthermore, new enrichment functions are introduced to model the junction and/or intersection of the discontinuities. The system of nonlinear equations is solved using the Newton–Raphson iterative algorithm with an implicit time stepping scheme.

Microcrack initiation and propagation prior to coalescence are represented by a nonlocal anisotropic Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) model in which the crack density is calculated explicitly. A damage threshold is defined to mark the beginning of crack coalescence. When that threshold is reached, a cohesive segment is inserted in the mesh to replace a portion of the damage process zone by a segment of discrete fracture. Discretization is done with the extended Finite Element Method (XFEM), which makes it possible to simulate fracture propagation without assigning the fracture path a priori. Rigorous calibration procedures are established for the cohesive strength (related to the damage threshold) and for the cohesive energy release rate, to ensure the balance of energy dissipated at the micro and macro scales. The XFEM-based tool is implemented into an open source object-oriented numerical package (OOFEM), and used to simulate wedge splitting and three-point bending tests. Results demonstrate that the proposed numerical method captures the entire failure process in mode I, from a mesh-independent diffuse damage zone to a localized fracture. Future work will investigate mixed mode fracture propagation.},

Examples of fracture simulations show that an incorrect separation of nodes due to a locally mispredicted crack direction leads to a severe stress locking, which produces spurious secondary cracking. As a possible remedy the paper advocates a new concept of a model with transition from a smeared to an embedded (discrete) crack. An additional improvement is achieved by reformulating the smeared part as non-local. Various criteria for placing the discontinuity are compared, and the optimal technique is identified. Remarkable insensitivity of the resulting model to mesh-induced directional bias is demonstrated. It is shown that the transition to an explicit description of a widely opening crack as a displacement discontinuity improves the behaviour of the combined model and remedies certain pathologies exhibited by regularized continuum models.

	abstract = {The recently emerged idea of incorporating strain or displacement discontinuities into standard ®nite element interpolations has triggered the development of powerful techniques that allow ecient modeling of regions with highly localized strains, e.g. of fracture process zones in concrete or shear bands in metals or soils. Following the pioneering work of Ortiz, Leroy, and Needleman, a number of studies on elements with embedded discontinuities were published during the past decade. It was demonstrated that local enrichments of the displacement and/or strain interpolation can improve the resolution of strain localization by ®nite element models. The multitude of approaches proposed in the literature calls for a comparative study that would present the diverse techniques in a uni®ed framework, point out their common features and dierences, and ®nd their limits of applicability. There are many aspects in which individual formulations dier, such as the type of discontinuity (weak/strong), variational principle used for the derivation of basic equations, constitutive law, etc. The present paper suggests a possible approach to their classi®cation, with special attention to the type of kinematic enhancement and of internal equilibrium condition. The dierences between individual formulations are elucidated by analyzing the behavior of the simplest ®nite element ± the constant-strain triangle (CST). The sources of stress locking (spurious stress transfer) reported by some authors are analyzed. It is shown that there exist three major classes of models with embedded discontinuities but only one of them gives the optimal element behavior. Ó 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

	title = {A cohesive zone model which is energetically equivalent to a gradient-enhanced coupled damage-plasticity model},
	abstract = {Modeling the fracture of a material can take two different approaches. A ﬁrst solution consists in using models which preserve a continuous description of the material throughout the fracture process. These models are often regularized in order to deal with the softening part of the material’s behavior properly. Another solution consists in introducing discontinuity surfaces into the structure along with the possibility of taking into account cohesive forces between the two sides of the discontinuity. Many works have been devoted to the establishment of a relation between these two families of models. The present work is based on the equivalent crack concept, which states that a localized damage zone can be replaced by a crack as long as the energy dissipated by the structure is preserved when switching models. In a ﬁrst paper, we introduced a method of construction of a cohesive law based on an elastic-damageable reference model. For a given test case, the cohesive model was built incrementally from the known solution given by the continuous reference model. There was no prerequisite assumption on the form of the cohesive law. In that work, the presence of plastic strains in the structure had not been taken into account, which limited the range of applicability of the method to elastic-damageable models. The objective of this paper is to eliminate this limitation by extending the method to the more general class of elasticeplastic damageable models.},

In the damaged zone, the damage variable is an explicit function of the level set. This function is a parameter of the model. Beyond a critical length, we assume the material to be totally damaged, thus allowing a straightforward transition to fracture. The damage growth is expressed as a level set propagation. The conﬁgurational force driving the damage front is non-local in the sense that it averages information over the thickness in the wake of the front. The computational and theoretical advantages of the new damage model are stressed. Numerical examples demonstrate the capability of the new model to initiate cracks and propagate them even in complex topological patterns (branching and merging for instance).

First, a semi analytical onedimensional study is carried out on a bar submitted to tensile loading (in the case of inhomogeneous symmetrical damage localisation) in order to identify a set of cohesive laws allowing to switch from damage growth to cohesive crack opening. This continuous/discontinuous approach is constructed so that energetic equivalence between both models remains ensured whatever the damage level reached when switching. This strategy is then extended to the ﬁnite element framework, in the case of 2D (and 3D) crack propagation under mode I loading conditions. Both non local and cohesive models are combined using a critical damage criterion which is checked at the end of each converged time step.},

The goals of the modiﬁed nonlocal formulation are threefold: (i) the distribution of damage at failure should be mesh independent; (ii) the model should be able to capture the continuous-discontinuous transition involved in the process of failure due to increasing stresses; (iii) the discontinuous displacements ﬁelds resulting from complete failure should be approached as closely as possible. A 1D example illustrates the capabilities of the original and enhanced models.

The level sets are computed to predict the crack path, and the path is corrected with the use of continuum damage mechanics. Once a certain level of damage is reached inside an element, the previously-computed level sets are used to apply the XFEM formulation. A cohesive XFEM formulation is used to transfer energy dissipation from the damage mechanics approach to the XFEM model. Using numerous test cases, it is shown that the model is mesh independent and that it removes the spurious stress transfer exhibited by continuum damage models. Various transition damage criteria are compared, and the optimal one is determined.},

The model is based on the concept of Continuum Damage Mechanics and is shown to be thermodynamically consistent. An integral-type nonlocal damage is adopted in the bulk to regularize the softening material response. The resulting nonlinear equations are solved using a Newton scheme with a dissipationbased arc-length constraint, for which an analytical Jacobian is derived. Several benchmark delamination studies, as well as failure analyses of a ﬁber/epoxy unit cell, are presented and discussed in detail.

On the one hand, continuous damage models succeed in capturing the initial diffuse damage stage but are not able to represent discontinuities or cracks. On the other hand, discontinuous methods, as the cohesive zones, which model the crack propagation behaviour, are suited to represent the localised damaging process. However, they are unable to represent diffuse damage. Moreover, most of the cohesive models do not capture triaxiality effect. In this paper, the advantages of the two approaches are combined in a single damage to crack transition framework. In a small deformation setting, a nonlocal elastic damage model is associated with a cohesive model in a discontinuous Galerkin finite element framework. A cohesive band model is used to naturally introduce a triaxiality-dependent behaviour inside the cohesive law. Practically, a numerical thickness is introduced to recover a 3D state, mandatory to incorporate the in-plane stretch effects. This thickness is evaluated to ensure the energy consistency of the method and is not a new numerical parameter. The traction-separation law is then built from the underlying damage model. The method is numerically shown to capture the stress triaxiality effect on the crack initiation and propagation.},

Although integral-type nonlocal regularization and gradient-type methods among those are widely accepted in the scientific community, gradient methods remain as a convenient approach due to its straightforwardness in linearization. The present paper provides a comparison of two different types of implicit-gradient formulations that consider an equivalent strain measure and the damage variable for gradient-enhancement.

Unlike the previous versions of critical state plasticity models presented in a series of ‘‘Cam-Clay’’ papers, the present model contains an additional state parameter w that allows for a deviation or detachment of the yield surface from the critical state line. Depending on the sign of this state parameter, the model can reproduce plastic compaction as well as plastic dilation in either loose or dense granular materials.

The integration rules fall under the category of return mapping algorithms in which the return directions are computed by closest point projection for associative flow rule and by central return mapping for non-associative flow rule applied to the Cam-Clay ellipsoids. Stress updates take place at the Gauss points upon enforcement of the consistency condition in which the appropriate consistency parameters are determined iteratively on the scalar level. Numerical examples with geotechnical applications, which include an analysis of foundation bearing capacity and an investigation of deformations in vertical cuts, are discussed to demonstrate the global accuracy and stability of the numerical solution. The relationships among various return mapping schemes are discussed in the context of both associative and non-associative flow rule formulations.},

For elastically isotropic materials, such models usually involve three-invariant plasticity formulations. Spectral decomposition has been used to increase the efficiency of numerical simulation for such models for the isotropically hardening case. We modify the spectral decomposition technique to models that include kinematic hardening. Finally, we perform some numerical simulations to demonstrate quadratic convergence.},

This cap model serves as an example for nonsmooth multisurface plasticity. Precise conditions for discrete loading in all possible modes are derived from the discrete Kuhn-Tucker conditions and new unconditionally stable closest point projection algorithms are presented. These are characterized by reducing local iterations on the constitutive equations to the solution of one nonlinear scalar equation for each of the different modes of the cap model. Tangent operators, consistent with the integration algorithm are derived, thus preserving the quadratic rate of convergence in a Newton solution procedure. It is shown that the original cap model does not obey the principle of maximum plastic dissipation, because the hardening law for the cap is nonassociative, which leads to the undesirable feature of unsymmetric consistent tangent moduli. To overcome this drawback an associative hardening law is proposed for a restricted class of problems.},

An adaptive second order semi-implicit method is developed in this paper. Its numerical behaviour is compared with an adaptive second order explicit scheme. The two proposed methods control the local error and guarantee numerical stability of the time integration.

	abstract = {Constitutive relations in elastoplasticity may be formulated in a variety of ways, and different update algorithms may be employed to solve the resulting equations. Several implicit integration schemes, although some not widely used, have been suggested in the last years. Among them, the closest point projection method (CPPM) has proven to be an effective and robust integration scheme. In order to gain maximum control of the stress projection, a two-level CPPM iteration scheme is proposed. The hardening variables are fixed during the stress projection onto consequently fixed yield surfaces, and after the stress projection, new values of the hardening variables are calculated defining new yield surfaces. The update of the hardening parameters which, in general, may be highly nonlinear functions, may be determined by a combination of a Picard Iteration (PI) on the hardening variables and an adaptative order inverse interpolation (AOII) on the difference of subsequent iterations of the hardening variables. The integration scheme has been implemented in a general constitutive driver which has been formulated independent of the selected constitutive model and easily linked to finite element codes. A third stress invariant dependent, cone–cap elastoplastic constitutive model, referred to as the MRS–Lade, with a highly non-linear hardening function has been used to show the applicability of the proposed iteration scheme. Error analyses and accuracy assessment are presented along with some representative test results. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},

For solving global problems, three different ways of generating the tangent operator are compared.

The model is representative of an important class of cyclic plasticity models for soils and includes both isotropic and nonlinear kinematic hardening. The implicit algorithm is based on the closest point projection method and the explicit algorithm follows a cutting-plane integration procedure. A sub-stepping technique was also implemented. The performance of these algorithms is assessed through a series of numerical simulations ranging from simulations of laboratory tests (such as triaxial and bi-axial compression, direct shear, and cyclic triaxial tests) to the analysis of a typical boundary value problem of geotechnical earthquake engineering. These simulations show that the closest point projection algorithm remains stable and accurate for relatively large strain increments and for cases where the mean effective stress in a soil element reaches very small values leading to a liquefaction state. It is also shown that while the cutting plane (CP) and sub-stepping (SS) algorithms provide high efficiency and good accuracy for small to medium size strain increments, their accuracy and efficiency deteriorate faster than the closest point projection method for large strain increments. The CP and SS algorithms also face convergence difficulties in the liquefaction analysis when the soil approaches very small mean effective stresses. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Such models provide an improvement on simple elasto-plastic models in describing soil behaviour under non-monotonic loading. Routine use of such models requires robust numerical integration schemes. Explicit integration of highly non-linear models requires extremely small steps in order to guarantee convergence. Here, a fully implicit scheme is presented for a simple kinematic hardening extension of the Cam clay soil model. The algorithm is based on the operator split methodology and the implicit Euler backward integration scheme is proposed to integrate the rate form of the constitutive relations. This algorithm maintains a quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence when used with a Newton–Raphson iterative procedure. Various strain-driven axisymmetric triaxial paths are simulated in order to demonstrate the efficiency and good performance of the proposed algorithm. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Effective explicit algorithms for integrating complex elastoplastic constitutive models, such as those belonging to the Cam clay family, are described. These automatically divide the applied strain increment into subincrements using an estimate of the local error and attempt to control the global integration error in the stresses. For a given scheme, the number of substeps used is a function of the error tolerance specified, the magnitude of the imposed strain increment, and the non‐linearity of the constitutive relations. The algorithms build on the work of Sloan in 1987 but include a number of important enhancements. The steps required to implement the integration schemes are described in detail and results are presented for a rigid footing resting on a layer of Tresca, Mohr‐Coulomb, modified Cam clay and generalised Cam clay soil. Explicit methods with automatic substepping and error control are shown to be reliable and efficient for these models. Moreover, for a given load path, they are able to control the global integration error in the stresses to lie near a specified tolerance. The methods described can be used for exceedingly complex constitutive laws, including those with a non‐linear elastic response inside the yield surface. This is because most of the code required to program them is independent of the precise form of the stress‐strain relations. In contrast, most of the implicit methods, such as the backward Euler return scheme, are difficult to implement for all but the simplest soil models.},

In addition, an associated consistent tangent matrix is derived. The performance of the model, as implemented with this new strategy, is explored in a range of 2D and 3D examples which include analyses based on direct and indirect fracture tests, a mixed mode fracture test, shear-normal tests in which aggregate interlock is significant and a reinforced concrete test in which cracking, aggregate interlock and crushing all contribute significantly to the behavior. It is concluded that the consistent computational approach gives solutions with good equilibrium convergence properties. Furthermore, it is concluded that the new model, as implemented in the finite element code, is able to represent a wide range of the behavior of plain and reinforced concrete structures.},

	abstract = {Recent biaxial experiments on spruce wood show that consideration of an elliptic failure surface according to Tsai and Wu, and of an elastic model for stress states within this envelope, gives an insufficient description of the mechanical behavior. As compression perpendicular to grain occurs, a nonlinear stress path results from a proportional biaxial strain path. Moreover, a phenomenological single-surface model does not permit easy identification of failure modes and thus renders the description of different post-failure mechanisms very difficult. Investigation of characteristic samples for various biaxial loading conditions enables the identification of four basic mechanisms covering the behavior of wood under plane stress conditions. The experimentally observed mechanical behavior will be described by means of a multi-surface plasticity model. It consists of four surfaces representing four basic failure modes. The first is a modified tension cut-off for the description of fiber rupture. The second is a mixed mode radial tension-shear model by Weihe applied to the perpendicular to grain direction. The third is an extension of the authors' prior model for perpendicular to grain compression, and the fourth surface covers the compressive failure parallel to grain. The model represents the orthotropic multi-surface elasto-plastic material clear wood. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss selected experimental data from biaxial tests with respect to distinct failure modes, and to develop an orthotropic plasticity model for its mathematical description. Since available experimental data cover only plane stress in the LR-plane,, both orthotropic failure and yield surfaces, respectively, are restricted to this case.},

However, the use of such analysis is still not widespread, and when it is used there is all too often evidence of bad practice. Part of the reason for this is a lack of education and of guidance, especially from codes of practice, as to the appropriate use of such methods of analysis. Clearly, some form of initiative is required to promote good practice and allow the full potential of this analysis tool to be realised, both from a safety and an economy perspective. This lecture begins by reviewing the key advantages of numerical analysis over conventional analysis tools, and then debates whether or not it can replace the conventional analysis tools in the design process. Examples from engineering practice are used extensively to illustrate the arguments both for and against the use of numerical analysis.},

	abstract = {A triaxial constitutive model is developed for elastoplastic behavior of geomaterials, which accounts for tensile damage. The constitutive setting is formulated in the framework of continuum thermodynamics using internal variables. The interaction of elastic damage and plastic ﬂow is examined with the help of very simple constitutive assumptions: (i) a Drucker–Prager yield function is used to deﬁne plastic loading of the material in combination with a non-associated ﬂow rule to control inelastic dilatancy; (ii) elastic damage is assumed to be isotropic and is represented by a single scalar variable that evolves under expansive volumetric strain. Thereby, positive volumetric deformations couple the dissipation mechanisms of elastic damage and plastic ﬂow which introduce degradation of the elastic stiﬀness as well as softening of the strength. The constitutive model is implemented in the ﬁnite element program ADINA to determine the response behavior of the combined damage-plasticity model under displacement and mixed control. A number of load histories are examined to illustrate the performance of the material model in axial tension, compression, shear and conﬁned compression. Thereby incipient failure is studied at the material level in the form of non-positive properties of the tangential material tensor of elastoplastic damage and the corresponding localization tensor comparing non-associative with associative plasticity formulations.},

Stiﬀness recovery caused by crack opening/closing is also incorporated. The strain equivalence hypothesis is used in deriving the constitutive equations such that the strains in the eﬀective (undamaged) and damaged conﬁgurations are set equal. This leads to a decoupled algorithm for the eﬀective stress computation and the damage evolution. It is also shown that the proposed constitutive relations comply with the laws of thermodynamics.

The numerical experiments show that CPPM working with a consistent elastoplastic modulus and a path independent strategy gives the best performance. It was also observed, however, that the CPA with a continuum elastoplastic modulus and path dependent strategy was quite stable and efﬁcient.

	abstract = {A coupled plasticity-damage model for plain concrete is presented in this paper. Based on continuum damage mechanics (CDM), an isotropic and anisotropic damage model coupled with a plasticity model is proposed in order to effectively predict and simulate plain concrete fracture. Two different damage evolution laws for both tension and compression are formulated for a more accurate prediction of the plain concrete behavior. In order to derive the constitutive equations and for the easiness in the numerical implementation, in the CDM framework the strain equivalence hypothesis is adopted such that the strain in the effective (undamaged) conﬁguration is equivalent to the strain in the nominal (damaged) conﬁguration. The proposed constitutive model has been shown to satisfy the thermodynamics requirements. Detailed numerical algorithms are developed for the ﬁnite element implementation of the proposed coupled plasticity-damage model. The numerical algorithm is coded using the user subroutine UMAT and then implemented in the commercial ﬁnite element analysis program Abaqus. Special emphasis is placed on identifying the plasticity and damage model material parameters from loading–unloading uniaxial test results. The overall performance of the proposed model is veriﬁed by comparing the model predictions to various experimental data, such as monotonic uniaxial tension and compression tests, monotonic biaxial compression test, loading–unloading uniaxial tensile and compressive tests, and mixed-mode fracture tests.},

	abstract = {A constitutive ply model is developed to allow for the simulation of laminated structures made of ﬁberreinforced polymers. The model accounts for stiffness degradation accompanied by strain hardening (i.e. distributed brittle damage), unrecoverable strain accumulation (i.e. multi-surface plasticity), and stiffness degradation accompanied by strain softening (i.e. localized brittle damage). Owing to the characteristics of such ply materials the model handles these effects and their evolutions in an anisotropic manner. The constitutive model is brieﬂy reviewed with respect to distributed damage and plasticity, and the extension to incorporate softening is given in detail. The implementation as material routine for an implicit FEM package and the computation of the material Jacobian matrix is presented. Additional measures are adopted for improving/achieving convergence, as being required for the treatment of material softening within numerical solution schemes.},

The model calibration by means of the provided material data is described and the limits of applicability of the proposed constitutive model are discussed. Finally, the predictions are presented as being obtained without any experimental results available. The test cases consider unidirectional and multidirectional laminates under biaxial loads, laminates under various loading conditions (uniaxial, bending, thermal, loading and unloading) and laminates with open hole under tension or compression. Most of the predictions are documented in terms of stress–strain curves and curves presenting the evolution of brittle damage and of plastic strains.},

As a consequence of zero elastic range the plastic strain increment direction, and consequently the elastic-plastic moduli fourth order tensor depends on the direction of the stress increment, rendering the model incrementally non-linear. The system of ordinary differential equations of the elastic-plastic formulation is intrinsically implicit. Thus, an iterative algorithm based on the Backward Euler numerical integration method and the damped Newton-Raphson method with an adaptive trial step is proposed in this work. The proposed methodology is applied to the zero elastic range SANISAND-Z model for sands and a thorough verification is done for various applied strain histories. The proposed integration scheme allows the use of SANISAND-Z or any other bounding surface zero elastic range model in displacementdriven finite element analysis.},

In this work, a continuum damage mechanics model proposed by the ﬁrst author is implemented with an integration method named cutting plane algorithm (CPA) to improve the robustness of the simulation. This integration method is one type of return mapping algorithm that bypasses the need for computing the gradients. We compare the current integration method with the previous direct method, and the result shows that the cutting plane algorithm exhibits excellent performance under large loading rate conditions. To enhance accuracy of the new method, a control procedure is utilized in the implementation of the algorithm based on error analysis. Thereafter, the theory of poromechanics is utilized with the damage model to account for the effects of ﬂuid diffusion. Laboratory tests simulated with ﬁnite element method illustrate distinct behaviors of shale with different loading rates and indicate the development of microcrack propagation under triaxial compression.

	abstract = {This is the second edition of the valuable reference source for numerical simulations of contact mechanics suitable for many fields like civil engineering, car design, aeronautics, metal forming, or biomechanics. Boundary value problems involving contact are of great importance in industrial applications in engineering such as bearings, metal forming processes, rubber seals, drilling problems, crash analysis of cars, rolling contact between car tires and the road, cooling of electronic devices... Other applications are related to biomechanical engineering design where human joints, implants or teeth are of consideration. Due to this variety, contact problems are today combined either with large elastic or inelastic deformations including time dependent responses. Thermal coupling also might have to be considered. Even stability behaviour has to be linked to contact. The topic of computational contact is described in depth providing an up-to-date treatment of different formulations, algorithms and discretisation techniques for contact problems which are established in the geometrically linear and nonlinear range. This book provides the necessary continuum mechanics background which includes the derivation of the contact constraints. Constitutive equations stemming from tribology which are valid at the contact interface are discussed in detail. Discretization schemes for small and finite deformations are discussed in depth. Solid and beam contact is considered as well as contact of unstable systems and thermomechanical contact. The algorithmic side covers a broad range of solution methods. Additionally adaptive discretisation techniques for contact analysis are presented as a modern tool for engineering design simulations. The present text book is written for graduate, Masters and PhD students, but also for engineers in industry, who have to simulate contact problems in practical application and wish to understand the theoretical and algorithmic background of contact treatment in modern finite element systems. For this second edition, illustrative simplified examples and new discretisation schemes as well as adaptive procedures for coupled problems are added.},

Here, deviations caused by some of its simplifications are quantified by comparing the analytical to a numerical model that allows the implementation of more complex geometries. The assumption of horizontal flow in the Thiem equation, which necessitates uniform inflow over the entire screen length of the fully penetrating well, was found to cause deviations from actual pumping wells where the pump is placed above the screen, resulting in non-uniform inflow and additional drawdown. The same applies to partially penetrating wells, where inflow peaks and additional drawdown occur, especially when the well is screened in the lower part of the aquifer. The use of the Thiem equation in the near-field of a well should thus be restricted to situations where the screen inflow is relatively uniformly distributed, e.g. when it covers large portions of the aquifer thickness. The presence of a gravel pack and a background gradient, on the other hand, are of limited importance.},

	abstract = {Fine particle suspensions (such as cornstarch mixed with water) exhibit dramatic changes in viscosity when sheared, producing fascinating behaviors that captivate children and rheologists alike. Recent examination of these mixtures in simple ﬂow geometries suggests inter-granular repulsion is central to this eﬀect — for mixtures at rest or shearing slowly, repulsion prevents frictional contacts from forming between particles, whereas, when sheared more forcefully, granular stresses overcome the repulsion allowing particles to interact frictionally and form microscopic structures that resist ﬂow. Previous constitutive studies of these mixtures have focused on particular cases, typically limited to two-dimensional, steady, simple shearing ﬂows. In this work, we introduce a predictive and general, three-dimensional continuum model for this material, using mixture theory to couple the ﬂuid and particle phases. Playing a central role in the model, we introduce a micro-structural state variable, whose evolution is deduced from small-scale physical arguments and checked with existing data. Our spaceand time-dependent model is implemented numerically in a variety of unsteady, non-uniform ﬂow conﬁgurations where it is shown to accurately capture a variety of key behaviors: (i) the continuous shear thickening (CST) and discontinuous shear thickening (DST) behavior observed in steady ﬂows, (ii) the time-dependent propagation of ‘shear jamming fronts’, (iii) the time-dependent propagation of ‘impact activated jamming fronts’, and (iv) the non-Newtonian, ‘running on oobleck’ eﬀect wherein fast locomotors stay aﬂoat while slow ones sink.},

This paper proposes a continuum model for simulating the mixing of monodisperse particles by combining the μ(I) rheological theory and the convection−diﬀusion transport equation. The model, implemented via an operator-split scheme, is completely temporal−spatial and able to deal with both continuous ﬂows and transient avalanches. Equipped with a rate-dependent diﬀusivity, it well recovers the particle concentration at diﬀerent stages of mixing in slowly rotating drum. Moreover, having been used to simulate granular ﬂow under diﬀerent conditions, the proposed continuum model may have the potential as a general model to describe particle mixing in diﬀerent processes.},

This review paper oﬀers a summary of granular ﬂow rheologies for well-developed or steady-state motion, and seeks to explain this dichotomy through the vast range of complexity intrinsic to these models. A key observation is that to achieve accuracy in predicting ﬂow ﬁelds in general geometries, one requires a model that accounts for a number of subtleties, most notably a nonlocal eﬀect to account for cooperativity in the ﬂow as induced by the ﬁnite size of grains. On the other hand, forces and tractions that develop on macro-scale, submerged boundaries appear to be minimally aﬀected by grain size and, barring very rapid motions, are well represented by simple rate-independent frictional plasticity models. A major simpliﬁcation observed in experiments of granular intrusion, which we refer to as the ‘resistive force hypothesis’ of granular Resistive Force Theory, can be shown to arise directly from rate-independent plasticity. Because such plasticity models have so few parameters, and the major rheological parameter is a dimensionless internal friction coeﬃcient, some of these simpliﬁcations can be seen as consequences of scaling.},

This approach results in a non-standard microforce balance, which when combined with our choice of speciﬁc constitutive equations, takes the form of a partial differential relation that the ﬂuidity must obey.

A rearrangement at one position is triggered by the stress fluctuations induced by rearrangements elsewhere in the material. Within this framework, the constitutive law, which gives the relation between the shear rate and the stress distribution, is written as an integral over the entire flow. Taking into account the finite time of local rearrangements, the model is applicable from the quasi-static regime up to the inertial regime. We have checked the prediction of the model in two different configurations, namely granular flows down inclined planes and plane shear under gravity, and we show that many of the experimental observations are predicted within the self-activated model.},

We derive a compact model for the rheology of the material, which accounts for the exact nonsmooth Drucker-Prager yield criterion combined with a varying volume fraction. Thanks to a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme and a careful spatial discretization of our rheology built upon the Material-Point Method, we are able to preserve at each time step the exact coupling between normal and tangential stresses, in a stable way. This contrasts with previous approaches which either regularize or linearize the yield criterion for implicit integration, leading to unrealistic behaviors or visible grid artifacts. Remarkably, our discrete problem turns out to be very similar to the discrete contact problem classically encountered in multibody dynamics, which allows us to leverage robust and efficient nonsmooth solvers from the literature. We validate our method by successfully capturing typical macroscopic features of some classical experiments, such as the discharge of a silo or the collapse of a granular column. Finally, we show that our method can be easily extended to accommodate more complex scenarios including two-way rigid body coupling as well as anisotropic materials.},

Three benchmark simulations on dry sands are presented to validate the model: (a) a set of plane strain collapse tests, (b) a set of 3D collapse tests, and (c) a plane strain simulation of the impact force generated by granular ﬂow on a rigid wall. Comparison with experimental results suggests that the formulation is sufﬁciently robust and accurate to model the continuum hydrodynamics of dry granular ﬂows in a laboratory setting. Results of the simulations suggest the potential of the formulation for modeling more complex, ﬁeld-scale scenarios characterized by more elaborate geometry and multiphysical processes.

The structure of these equations allows for extension to general rheologies based on complex and realistic constitutive models. Substantial eﬀort has been put into describing the eﬀect of the shear rate, i.e. the magnitude of the velocity gradient, on the shear stress. Here we analyse the eﬀect of the deformation type. We apply the theories of Mohr–Coulomb and Matsuoka–Nakai to calculate the stresses under diﬀerent deformation types and compare results to the theory of Drucker–Prager, which is formulated independently of the deformation type. This model is particularly relevant because it is the basis for many granular rheologies, such as the µ (I)–rheology. All models have been implemented into the open-source toolkit OpenFOAM® for a practical application. We found that, within the context of these models, the deformation type has a large inﬂuence on the stress. However, for the geometries considered here, these diﬀerences are limited to speciﬁc zones which have little inﬂuence on the landslide kinematics. Finally we are able to give indicators on when the deformation type should be considered in modelling of landslides and when it can be neglected.},

	title = {Multi-scale multiphase modelling of granular flows},
	url = {https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/252953},
	abstract = {Geophysical hazards usually involve multiphase flow of dense granular solids and water. Understanding the mechanics of granular flow is of particular importance in predicting the run-out behaviour of debris flows. The dynamics of a homogeneous granular flow involve three distinct scales: the microscopic scale, the meso-scale, and the macroscopic scale. Conventionally, granular flows are modelled as a continuum because they exhibit many collective phenomena. Recent studies, however, suggest that a continuum law may be unable to capture the effect of inhomogeneities at the grain scale level, such as orientation of force chains, which are micro-structural effects. Discrete element methods (DEM) are capable of simulating these micro-structural effects, however they are computationally expensive. In the present study, a multi-scale approach is adopted, using both DEM and continuum techniques, to better understand the rheology of granular flows and the limitations of continuum models. 
 
The collapse of a granular column on a horizontal surface is a simple case of granular flow; however, a proper model that describes the flow dynamics is still lacking. In the present study, the generalised interpolation material point method (GIMPM), a hybrid Eulerian – Lagrangian approach, is implemented with the Mohr-Coloumb failure criterion to describe the continuum behaviour of granular flows. The granular column collapse is also simulated using DEM to understand the micro-mechanics of the flow. The limitations of MPM in modelling the flow dynamics are studied by inspecting the energy dissipation mechanisms. The lack of collisional dissipation in the Mohr-Coloumb model results in longer run-out distances for granular flows in dilute regimes (where the mean pressure is low). However, the model is able to capture the rheology of dense granular flows, such as the run-out evolution of slopes subjected to lateral excitation, where the inertial number I {\textless} 0.1. 
 
The initiation and propagation of submarine flows depend mainly on the slope, density, and quantity of the material destabilised. Certain macroscopic models are able to capture simple mechanical behaviours, however the complex physical mechanisms that occur at the grain scale, such as hydrodynamic instabilities and formation of clusters, have largely been ignored. In order to describe the mechanism of submarine granular flows, it is important to consider both the dynamics of the solid phase and the role of the ambient fluid. In the present study, a two-dimensional coupled Lattice Boltzmann LBM – DEM technique is developed to understand the micro-scale rheology of granular flows in fluid. Parametric analyses are performed to assess the influence of initial configuration, permeability, and slope of the inclined plane on the flow. The effect of hydrodynamic forces on the run-out evolution is analysed by comparing the energy dissipation and flow evolution between dry and immersed conditions.},

The unification is achieved by means of “parametric” viscoelasticity and hypoplasticity based on elastic and inelastic potentials. Fully nonlinear, anisotropic viscoelastoplastic models are achieved by expressing potentials as functions of the joint isotropic invariants of kinematic and structural tensors. These take on the role of evolutionary parameters or “internal variables,” whose evolution equations are derived from the internal balance of generalized forces. The resulting continuum models encompass most of the mechanical constitutive equations currently employed for granular media. Moreover, these models are readily modified to include Cosserat and other multipolar effects. Several outstanding questions are identified as to the contribution of parameter evolution to dissipation; the distinction between quasielastic and inelastic models of material instability; and the role of multipolar effects in material instability, dense rapid flow, and particle migration phenomena.},

The reliability of the -rheology in the case of complex transient flows is not fully ascertained, however. From this perspective, the granular column collapse experiment provides an interesting benchmark. In this paper we implement the -rheology in a Navier–Stokes solver (Gerris) and compare the resulting solutions with both analytical solutions and two-dimensional contact dynamics discrete simulations. In a first series of simulations, we check the numerical model in the case of a steady infinite two-dimensional granular layer avalanching on an inclined plane. A second layer of Newtonian fluid is then added over the granular layer in order to recover a close approximation of a free-surface condition. Comparisons with analytical and semi-analytical solutions provide conclusive validation of the numerical implementation of the -rheology. In a second part, we simulate the unsteady two-dimensional collapse of granular columns over a wide range of aspect ratios. Systematic comparisons with discrete two-dimensional contact dynamics simulations show good agreement between the two methods for the inner deformations and the time evolution of the shape during most of the flow, while a systematic underestimation of the final run-out is observed. The experimental scalings of spreading of the column as a function of the aspect ratio available from the literature are also recovered. A discussion follows on the performances of other rheologies, and on the sensitivity of the simulations to the parameters of the -rheology.},

	abstract = {We present a thermodynamically consistent constitutive model for fluid-saturated sediments, spanning dense to dilute regimes, developed from the basic balance laws for two phase-mixtures. The model can represent various limiting cases, such as pure fluid and dry grains. It is formulated to capture a number of key behaviors such as: (i) viscous inertial rheology of submerged wet grains under steady shearing flows, (ii) the critical state behavior of grains, which causes granular Reynolds dilation/contraction due to shear, (iii) the viscous thickening of the fluid response due to the presence of suspended grains, and (iv) the Darcy-like drag interaction observed in both dense and dilute mixtures, which gives rise to complex fluid-grain interactions under dilation and flow. The full constitutive model is combined with the basic equations of motion for each mixture phase and implemented in the material point method (MPM) to accurately model the coupled dynamics of the mixed system. Qualitative results show the breadth of problems which this model can address. Quantitative results demonstrate the accuracy of this model as compared with analytical limits and experimental observations of fluid and grain behaviors in inhomogeneous geometries.},

	abstract = {Large deformation soil behavior underpins the operation and performance for a wide range of key geotechnical structures and needs to be properly considered in their modeling, analysis, and design. The material point method (MPM) has gained increasing popularity recently over conventional numerical methods such as finite element method (FEM) in tackling large deformation problems. In this study, we present a novel hierarchical coupling scheme to integrate MPM with discrete element method (DEM) for multiscale modeling of large deformation in geomechanics. The MPM is employed to treat a typical boundary value problem that may experience large deformation, and the DEM is used to derive the nonlinear material response from small strain to finite strain required by MPM for each of its material points. The proposed coupling framework not only inherits the advantages of MPM in tackling large deformation engineering problems over the use of FEM (eg, no need for remeshing to avoid mesh distortion in FEM), but also helps avoid the need for complicated, phenomenological assumptions on constitutive material models for soil exhibiting high nonlinearity at finite strain. The proposed framework lends great convenience for us to relate rich grain-scale information and key micromechanical mechanisms to macroscopic observations of granular soils over all deformation levels, from initial small-strain stage en route to large deformation regime before failure. Several classic geomechanics examples are used to demonstrate the key features the new MPM/DEM framework can offer on large deformation simulations, including biaxial compression test, rigid footing, soil-pipe interaction, and soil column collapse.},

The subsequent MPM calculations for a model silo were performed with different initial void ratios of sand and silo wall roughness. The flow simulations took also into account the different both location and width of the outlet. The emphasis was on the evolution of both shear zones (wall and internal curvilinear shear zones) and their impact on wall stresses/forces during flow. The numerical findings enhance the understanding of shear localization in granular materials during confined controlled flow in silos and its immense effect on the magnitude and distribution of wall pressures.},

A good agreement for the velocity is obtained in the regions of rapid ﬂows, while areas of slow creep are not entirely captured by the continuum model. The pressure ﬁeld shows a general good agreement, while bulk deformations are found to be similar in both approaches. The inﬂuence of the parameters of the μ(I) ﬂow law is systematically investigated, showing the importance of the dependence on the inertial number I to achieve quantitative agreement between continuum and discrete discharge. However, potential problems involving the systems size, the conﬁguration and “non-local” eﬀects, are suggested.

This study applies numerical simulations to investigate reservoir impedance and thermal production. Because of the great depth of the geothermal reservoir, few data are available to characterize reservoir features and properties. As a result, the study focuses on the following three aspects: 1. model choice for predicting reservoir impedance and thermal breakthrough: after investigating three potential models (one single permeability model and two dual permeability models) for ﬂow through fractured rock, it is decided only the single permeability model is needed; 2. well placement (horizontal vs. vertical) options: horizontal well placement seems to be more robust to heterogeneity and the impedance is more acceptable; 3. Prediction uncertainty: the most inﬂuential parameters are identiﬁed using a First-OrderSecond-Moment uncertainty propagation analysis, and the uncertain range of the model predictions is estimated by performing a Monte Carlo simulation. Heterogeneity has a large impact on the prediction, therefore, heterogeneity is included in the predictive model and uncertainty analysis. The numerical model results and uncertainty analysis will be used for further economic studies.},

Because material points are randomly distributed, and remain so under afﬁne deformations, the MPMC eliminates artifacts of the simulation grid that occur in lattice-based methods such as the Monte Carlo Potts model. For model systems the MPMC is veriﬁed to correctly reproduce grain boundary motion caused by bulk and interfacial driving forces.

	abstract = {As one of the additive manufacturing technologies, selective laser melting has shown a good potential yet still having technical barriers, such as residual stress management which can determine the manufacturability and integrity of a component. Simulating this process on a full scale also needs to face a large physical scale difference, which makes the current numerical method difficult to adapt. Currently, it seems that finite element modelling is a natural choice to address those challenges in additive manufacturing. However, it is still challenging to overcome the huge gap in time and length scales in a powder-bed fusion process. Furthermore, a requirement of adding new materials is hard to model in a finite element method because of the difficulty of rezoning a finite element mesh, especially in a 3-D complex shape while a material point method can take fewer efforts to add materials than a finite element model and has been employed in simulations such as large deformation and crack failure problems. Those potentially happened in additive manufacturing process are still tough nuts using finite element method. This thesis presents work on using material point method to simulate the selective laser melting process at the full component scale. Using this model, a series of investigations are performed to demonstrate the effects of different scan strategies, boundary conditions and geometrical shapes. This is the first attempt to simulate an additive manufacturing process using the material point method at a full component scale. A ghost point method is developed to imitate the adding of materials in the manufacturing process. This function is controlled by a time step counter with only two results: 1 and 0. In this model, the mapping process of mass and momentum between node and material points are modified and controlled by multiplying this function. As a result, the unopened material points have a mass and momentum of zero during mapping process so that these material points temporarily disappear in the system. Furthermore, combining this method with the coordinate transformation system can achieve a different scanning strategy. Three simplified underlying physics, including residual stress, solid-state phase transformation and thermal strain, are considered and added in material point model. All three sub-models are based on existing literature or data for simplicity and the constitutive model has been modified accordingly. These models can be added directly to the material points to be achieved with the material point to open and close together. From the simulation results, material point program has achieved a good function of each sub-physics. Additionally, an optimization program, which switches on the material points layer by layer, is performed to significantly reduce the computational throughput for simulating residual stress effects in selective laser melting. The material point code is developed from an open source code called MPM3D-f90. This model is a macro-scale analysis which is implemented on desktop PC. Compared to the finite element model, the simulation time is greatly reduced. Therefore, the material point method has the potential to become a powerful tool in simulating selective laser melting.},

	abstract = {Simulating the physical behaviors of deformable objects and fluids has been an important topic in computer graphics. While the Lagrangian Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used for elasto-plastic solids, it usually requires additional computational components in the case of large deformation, mesh distortion, fracture, self-collision and coupling between materials. Often, special solvers and strategies need to be developed for a particular problem. Recently, the hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method (MPM) was introduced to the graphics community. It uses a continuum description of the governing equations and utilizes user-controllable elasto-plastic constitutive models. The hybrid nature of MPM allows using a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. Like other particle methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), topology change is easy due to the lack of explicit connectivity between Lagrangian particles. Furthermore, MPM allows a grid-based implicit integration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. MPM also provides a unified particle simulation framework similar to Position Based Dynamics (PBD) for easy coupling of different materials. The power of MPM has been demonstrated in a number of recent papers for simulating various materials including elastic objects, snow, lava, sand and viscoelastic fluids. It is also highly integrated into the production framework of Walt Disney Animation Studios and has been used in featured animations including Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia.},

	abstract = {Simulating fluids and solid materials undergoing large deformation remains an important and challenging problem in Computer Graphics. The dynamics of these materials usually involve dramatic topological changes and therefore require sophisticated numerical approaches to achieve sufficient accuracy and visual realism. This dissertation focuses on the Material Point Method (MPM) for simulating solids and fluids for use in computer animation, and it makes four major contributions: First, we introduce new MPM for simulating viscoelastic fluids, foams and sponges. Our second contribution is to introduce a novel technique designed to retain the stability of the original PIC, without suffering from the noise and instability of FLIP. Our third contribution is to introduce a novel material point method for heat transport, melting and solidifying materials. Our fourth contribution is to show that recasting the backward Euler method as a minimization problem allows Newton's method to be stabilized by standard optimization techniqueswith some novel improvements of our own.},

MLS-MPM naturally leads to the formulation of Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) [Jiang et al. 2015] and Polynomial Particle-In-Cell [Fu et al. 2017] in a way that is consistent with a Galerkin-style weak form discretization of the governing equations. Additionally, it enables a new stress divergence discretization that effortlessly allows all MPM simulations to run two times faster than before. We also develop a Compatible Particle-In-Cell (CPIC) algorithm on top of MLS-MPM. Utilizing a colored distance field representation and a novel compatibility condition for particles and grid nodes, our framework enables the simulation of various new phenomena that are not previously supported by MPM, including material cutting, dynamic open boundaries, and two-way coupling with rigid bodies. MLS-MPM with CPIC is easy to implement and friendly to performance optimization.},

	abstract = {The use of groundwater systems for heat storage increasingly gains interest among water managers, policy makers and researchers as a way to increase the efﬁciency of energy production and to allow the re-use of waste heat. Typically, mono-well storage systems are thought to require the use of separate aquifers. This study assessed the suitability of using heat and cold storage in a single deep geothermal aquifer for district heating and cooling. An integrated modelling approach was used for evaluating the controls on the energy efﬁciency of high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage (HT-ATES). The temperature difference ( T) of 40 ◦C between the injection temperatures for the cold and warm storages 20 ◦C and 60 ◦C was signiﬁcant, which required accounting for transient variation of density and viscosity due to temperature and pressure within the modelling code SEAWAT. The developed model was applied for a geothermal reservoir from the Moesian platform, in the Bucharest area, Romania. The sensitivity of the system efﬁciency was analyzed with respect to the main physical (density, viscosity, longitudinal dispersivity) and operational design parameters (distance between warm and cold storage volumes, ﬂow rates). Uncertainties in geological heterogeneity and the associated range in longitudinal dispersivity values (5–50 m) resulted in signiﬁcant efﬁciency differences (80–55\%). While reducing the lateral distance between multiple mono-well systems increased their overall efﬁciency due to positive thermal interference, a minimum vertical distance of (160 m) was required between the injection/extraction ﬁlters to prevent interaction between the cold and warm storage volumes. Overall, this study highlights the potential of using a cost-effective mono-well system for HT-ATES in single deep geothermal groundwater systems.},

	abstract = {The storage of heat in aquifers, also referred to as Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES), bears a high potential to bridge the seasonal gap between periods of highest thermal energy demand and supply. With storage tem­ peratures higher than 50 ◦C, High-Temperature (HT) ATES is capable to facilitate the integration of (non-) renewable heat sources into complex energy systems. While the complexity of ATES technology is positively correlated to the required storage temperature, HT-ATES faces multidisciplinary challenges and risks impeding a rapid market uptake worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide an overview and analysis of these risks of HT-ATES to facilitate global technology adoption. Risk are identified considering experiences of past HTATES projects and analyzed by ATES and geothermal energy experts. An online survey among 38 international experts revealed that technical risks are expected to be less critical than legal, social and organizational risks. This is confirmed by the lessons learned from past HT-ATES projects, where high heat recovery values were achieved, and technical feasibility was demonstrated. Although HT-ATES is less flexible than competing tech­ nologies such as pits or buffer tanks, the main problems encountered are attributed to a loss of the heat source and fluctuating or decreasing heating demands. Considering that a HT-ATES system has a lifetime of more than 30 years, it is crucial to develop energy concepts which take into account the conditions both for heat sources and heat sinks. Finally, a site-specific risk analysis for HT-ATES in the city of Hamburg revealed that some risks strongly depend on local boundary conditions. A project-specific risk management is therefore indispensable and should be addressed in future research and project developments.},

The impact on production rates and well integrity is performed by coupled process modeling based on linking a reservoir-wellbore simulator with a geomechanical simulator, whereas potential scaling is analyzed by geochemical modeling. We consider production from a liquid-dominated system using data from the Casa Diablo geothermal field, California. The simulations related to well integrity show that production-induced temperature and pressure changes can cause non-linear mechanical responses, including frictional sliding at material interfaces and material yielding. However, if the production rates are controlled between certain limits, e.g., ramping up production slowly and not completely shutting down the production in each cycle, the impact on the well assembly can be minimized. Simulations of scaling show that the effects of scaling and corrosion can be controlled by keeping the wellhead pressure above the saturation pressure and at the same time keeping the temperature above the silica saturation temperature.},

	title = {Implementation and {Validation} of an {Advanced} {Hypoplastic} {Model} for {Granular} {Material} {Behavior}},
	abstract = {Problems in soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering are often characterized by large deformations and complex material behavior. For example, the mechanical behavior of granular materials like sand is highly nonlinear due to the presence of an evolving internal structure formed by the grains. The strength and stiffness is generally a function of the stress and density state and the loading history. While LS-DYNA® has proved to be among the most robust hydrocodes for modelling large deformations and dynamic problems, it currently does not provide material models capturing granular material behavior over a wide range of stress and density states under monotonic and cyclic loads with only one set of parameters for a specific granular material and incorporating state parameters such as void ratio. Therefore, an advanced soil mechanical constitutive equation based on the hypoplasticity framework has been implemented in LS-DYNA using the UMAT interface in conjunction with the *USER\_DEFINED\_MATERIAL\_MODEL keyword. The implemented hypoplastic model defines evolution equations for the effective stress, void ratio, and the so-called intergranular strain tensor suitable for simulating cyclic loading effects. Previously, the model has been successfully implemented in other hydrocodes. However, in comparison to other hydrocodes, LS-DYNA employs more advanced element technology, such as the Multi-Material Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (MMALE) formulation, to simulate large deformation problems. The motivation of this study was to combine the hypoplastic material model with MMALE to study more realistically problems in soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering. The implementation is validated by comparing to results of oedometer and triaxial laboratory tests. It is shown that the UMAT is able to simulate soil behavior under cyclic loading and undrained conditions. The combination of the UMAT with MMALE is evaluated using the example of a sand column collapse. The numerical results are in good agreement with experimental test results and can be seen as a promising starting point for further applications.},

The resulting code builds on the modular architecture of ESCRIPTRT to solve sequentially these coupled THMC mechanisms and a number of feedback mechanisms including shear heating and damage. Damage in the host rock is linked to porosity evolution which in turn affects permeability, and this permeability-damage dependency is validated against published results. The motivation behind the development of this code is to improve our understanding of the formation of hydrothermal ore deposits, and we illustrate the use of this numerical tool with a simple geologic scenario involving shear zone development and albitisation. This application example focuses on the effects of damage on permeability enhancement and resultant ﬂuid ﬂow. Using damage mechanics allows for the localisation of narrower shear zones and reproduces the logarithmic pattern of rock pulverisation observed in nature on the sides of shear zones. The damage induced permeability evolution creates ﬂuid pathways which may play a major role in forming hydrothermal ore-deposits.},

The volumetric properties of all ﬂuid phases from low-density vapor to hydrous salt melts and single-phase binary ﬂuids at high pressures and temperatures, can be described by a simple equation V solutionðT ; P ; X NaClÞ ¼ V H2Oðn1 þ n2T ; P Þ i.e., for a given pressure and composition, the molar volume of the solution is related to the molar volume of pure water at the same pressure by a linear scaling of temperature. The parameters n1 and n2 are simple functions of pressure and composition. This linear relation could be demonstrated for all (P, XNaCl) pairs where accurate volumetric data are available over a suﬃciently large temperature interval. Extrapolations over as much as 300 °C predict high temperature data within their experimental uncertainty of 1–2\%. With a simple ﬁt of parameters n1 and n2, the vast majority of several thousand experimental data points from the literature can be reproduced within experimental error, including dilute solutions in the compressible region. Although a strict theoretical foundation is lacking, this behavior can phenomenologically be rationalized as reﬂecting the relation between the linear to near-linear isochores of binary ﬂuids to those of pure water. Accordingly, small deviations from linearity that amount to 0.1–0.2\% error in molar volume occur only at low temperatures where the pure water isochores behave non-linearly. This eﬀect is accounted for by introducing a deviation function. Given its high accuracy, the formulation for the molar volumes could be integrated along isotherms–isobars to generate data for the speciﬁc enthalpy of binary solutions. In order to allow direct computation rather than numerical integration, a correlation scheme was developed that is mathematically similar to that for molar volumes. Speciﬁc enthalpies computed from the correlation typically agree within 1–3\% with those obtained from other studies. Similarly, isobaric heat capacities show good agreement with published data except for high salinities at moderate pressures and temperatures.},

	abstract = {In contrast to conventional hydrothermal systems or enhanced geothermal systems, CO2 Plume Geothermal (CPG) systems generate electricity by using CO2 that has been geothermally heated due to sequestration in a sedimentary basin. Four CPG and two brine-based geothermal systems are modeled to estimate their power production for sedimentary basin reservoir depths between 1 and 5 km, geothermal temperature gradients from 20 to 50 °C kmÀ1, reservoir permeabilities from 1 Â 10À15 to 1 Â 10À12 m2 and well casing inner diameters from 0.14 m to 0.41 m. Results show that CPG direct-type systems produce more electricity than brine-based geothermal systems at depths between 2 and 3 km, and at permeabilities between 10À14 and 10À13 m2, often by a factor of two. This better performance of CPG is due to the low kinematic viscosity of CO2, relative to brine at those depths, and the strong thermosiphon effect generated by CO2. When CO2 is used instead of R245fa as the secondary working ﬂuid in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), the power production of both the CPG and the brine–reservoir system increases substantially; for example, by 22\% and 20\% for subsurface brine and CO2 systems, respectively, with a 35 °C kmÀ1 thermal gradient, 0.27 m production and 0.41 m injection well diameters, and 5 Â 10À14 m2 reservoir permeability.},

Although there is a limitation in the widespread use of the HTATES system because of several technical problems such as clogging, corrosion, etc., it is getting more attention as these issues are gradually alleviated. In this study, a sensitivity analysis of recovery efﬁciency in two cases of HT-ATES system with a single well is conducted to select key parameters. For a fractional factorial design used to choose input parameters with uniformity, the optimal Latin hypercube sampling with an enhanced stochastic evolutionary algorithm is considered. Then, the recovery efﬁciency is obtained using a computer model developed by COMSOL Multiphysics. With input and output variables, the surrogate modeling technique, namely the Gaussian-Kriging method with Smoothly Clopped Absolute Deviation Penalty, is utilized. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is performed based on the variation decomposition. According to the result of sensitivity analysis, the most important input variables are selected and conﬁrmed to consider the interaction effects for each case and it is conﬁrmed that key parameters vary with the experiment domain of hydraulic and thermal properties as well as the number of input variables.},

	abstract = {Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) is a cost-effective technology that enables the reduction of energy use and CO2 emissions associated with the heating and cooling of buildings by storage and recovery of large quantities of thermal energy in the subsurface. Reducing the distance between wells in large-scale application of ATES increases the total amount of energy that can be provided by ATES in a given area. However, due to thermal interference the performance of individual systems can decrease. In this study a novel method is presented that can be used to (a) determine the impact of thermal interference on the economic and environmental performance of ATES and (b) optimize well distances in large-scale applications. The method is demonstrated using the hydrogeological conditions of Amsterdam, Netherlands. Results for this case study show that it is cost-effective to allow a limited amount of thermal interference, such that 30–40\% more energy can be provided in a given area compared to the case in which all negative thermal interference is avoided. Sensitivity analysis indicates that optimal well distance is moderately insensitive to changes in hydrogeological and economic conditions. Maximum economic beneﬁt compared to conventional heating and cooling systems on the other hand is sensitive, especially to changes in the gas price and storage temperatures.},

	abstract = {In the past, the analytical model developed for a radially divergent heat ﬂow in an aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) system considers only the process of either thermal conduction or thermal dispersion. In addition, the existing models commonly regarded the inner boundary at the injection well as the constant‐temperature condition, which does not meet the continuity condition of heat ﬂux at the wellbore. We herein propose an analytical model for a realistic representation of heat ﬂow in an ATES system by considering the effects of both thermal conduction and thermal dispersion in the heat transfer equation and a Robin‐type boundary condition at the injection well. The model consists of three heat ﬂow equations depicting the temperature distributions in the conﬁned aquifer and its underlying and overlying rocks. The Laplace transform method is applied to solve the proposed model. The solutions for the cases of dispersion‐ and conduction‐dominant ﬂow ﬁelds are also developed and discussed. Comparisons between the present solutions with ﬁve existing solutions developed for similar heated water injection problems are made. A global sensitivity method is also performed to analyze the thermal response to the change in each of the aquifer parameters. Finally, our solution is validated through the comparison with the ﬁnite difference solution and observed data from an ATES experiment site in Mobile, Alabama.},

	abstract = {Thermal energy storage can be accomplished through the installation of an array of vertical boreholes. Coupled hydrogeological-thermal simulation of the storage system is essential to provide an optimized configuration of boreholes and operation schedule for the thermal storage system on the site. This paper presents numerical investigations and thermohydraulic evaluation of open borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) system operating under cyclic flow regime. A three-dimensional numerical model for groundwater flow and heat transport is used to determine the annual variation of recovery temperature from the borehole thermal energy storage. The model includes the effects of convection and conduction heat transfer, heat loss to the adjacent confining strata, and hydraulic anisotropy. The operation scenario consists of cyclic injection and recovery after holding interval and four periods per year to simulate the seasonal temperature conditions. For different parameters of the system, performances were compared in terms of extraction temperature. The calculated water temperature at the producing pipe remains relatively constant within a certain range through the year. Heat loss, injection/production rate, and geometrical configuration of boreholes and aquifer used in the model are shown to impact the predicted temperature profiles at each stage and the recovery water temperature. However, injection temperature and hydraulic anisotropy have a less significant effect on the performance of BTES systems. Absolute permeability does not affect the temperature, but is inversely proportional to the injection pressure.},

	abstract = {The performance of the ATES (aquifer thermal energy storage) system primarily depends on the thermal interference between warm and cold thermal energy stored in an aquifer. Additionally the thermal interference is mainly affected by the borehole distance, the hydraulic conductivity, and the pumping/ injection rate. Thermo-hydraulic modeling was performed to identify the thermal interference by three parameters and to estimate the system performance change by the thermal interference. Modeling results indicate that the thermal interference grows as the borehole distance decreases, as the hydraulic conductivity increases, and as the pumping/injection rate increases. The system performance analysis indicates that if h (the ratio of the length of the thermal front to the distance between two boreholes) is lower than unity, the system performance is not signiﬁcantly affected, but if h is equal to unity, the system performance falls up to w22\%. Long term modeling for a factory in Anseong was conducted to test the applicability of the ATES system. When the pumping/injection rate is 100 m3/day, system performances during the summer and winter after 3 years of operation are estimated to be w125 kW and w110 kW, respectively. Therefore, 100 m3/day of the pumping/injection rate satisﬁes the energy requirements (w70 kW) for the factory.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the analysis of a real case of multiple Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage systems. The Hague, the capital city of the province of South Holland in the Netherlands, is densely populated with many ATES systems. A total of 19 ATES systems are installed in an area of 3.8 km2 with a total of 76 functioning wells. The analysis focuses on the development of a coupled groundwater ﬂow and heat transfer model over a period of 10 years. Results are then post-processed to evaluate efﬁciency of each individual well and system. Efﬁciency of the ATES systems has ranged between 68\% and 87\%. The analysis showed that efﬁciency tends, in general, to increase over time and stabilize at an asymptotic value after few years. Analysis of interference among individual wells of an ATES system and wells of other systems showed that interference could, in fact, have a positive impact on the efﬁciency of a well/system. Interference can increase efﬁciency of an ATES system since it can help in trapping energy (cold or warm) within the capture zone of all operating ATES systems. In the study area, the interference phenomenon affects efﬁciency, in general, positively where it increases the efﬁciency of individually operating wells by a maximum of 20\%. However, the phenomenon also affects efﬁciency of some wells negatively where it reduces the efﬁciency of individually operating wells by a maximum of 25\%. In average, systems in the study area are positively affected by interferences among each other with an overall average of 3.2\% for all wells (over the 10 years operation period).},

This problem causes a gradual variation in the temperature of the pumping water and impacts the efﬁciency of the GWHP. In particular, a large scale GWHP system requires many wells; thus, the well location and arrangement become a considerable technological challenge. The aim of this study is to develop a numerical model for groundwater systems to obtain a fair comparison of the energy efﬁciency between different well locations and arrangement modes. In this study, four typical modes are studied to determine the thermal interaction inﬂuences, and the numerical model was veriﬁed with test data by using an artiﬁcial rock/soil test system. The comparisons show good agreement between the numerical date and the measured data. It is shown that the temperature variation is related to the well arrangement mode, and the row arrangement of well groups may be a better choice. Therefore, a suitable spacing well pattern in the limited area is helpful and can potentially decrease the intensity of the thermal interaction and resist the occurrence of thermal breakthrough.},

This makes the subsurface, including its groundwater, of crucial importance for primary energy savings. The regulation of ATES systems is similar in many countries around the world. This paper seeks solutions for the institutional hindrances to the diffusion of ATES. The use of aquifers by individual ATES systems can be optimized to maximize their efﬁciency on the one hand, and to optimize the performance of the regional subsurface for energy storage on the other. The application of ATES in an aquifer has similar properties as other common resource pool problems. Only with detailed information and feedback about the actual subsurface status, a network of ATES systems can work towards an optimum for both the subsurface and buildings, instead of striving for a local optimum for individual buildings. Future governance of the subsurface may include the self-organization or self-governance. For that the ATES systems need a complementary framework; interpretation of interaction, feedback and adaptable and dynamic control interpretations are the key elements for the optimal and sustainable use of the subsurface.},

	abstract = {A modeling study was carried out to evaluate the inﬂuence of aquifer heterogeneity, as represented by geologic layering, on heat transport and storage in an aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) system in Agassiz, British Columbia, Canada. Two 3D heat transport models were developed and calibrated using the ﬂow and heat transport code FEFLOW including: a “non-layered” model domain with homogeneous hydraulic and thermal properties; and, a “layered” model domain with variable hydraulic and thermal properties assigned to discrete geological units to represent aquifer heterogeneity. The base model (non-layered) shows limited sensitivity for the ranges of all thermal and hydraulic properties expected at the site; the model is most sensitive to vertical anisotropy and hydraulic gradient. Simulated and observed temperatures within the wells reﬂect a combination of screen placement and layering, with inconsistencies largely explained by the lateral continuity of high permeability layers represented in the model. Simulation of heat injection, storage and recovery show preferential transport along high permeability layers, resulting in longitudinal plume distortion, and overall higher short-term storage efﬁciencies.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) coupled thermo-hydrogeological numerical model for a conﬁned aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) system underlain and overlain by rock media has been presented in this paper. The ATES system operates in cyclic mode. The model takes into account heat transport processes of advection, conduction and heat loss to conﬁning rock media. The model also includes regional groundwater ﬂow in the aquifer in the longitudinal and lateral directions, geothermal gradient and anisotropy in the aquifer. Results show that thermal injection into the aquifer results in the generation of a thermalfront which grows in size with time. The thermal interference caused by the premature thermalbreakthrough when the thermal-front reaches the production well results in the fall of system performance and hence should be avoided. This study models the transient temperature distribution in the aquifer for different ﬂow and geological conditions which may be effectively used in designing an efﬁcient ATES project by ensuring safety from thermal-breakthrough while catering to the energy demand. Parameter studies are also performed which reveals that permeability of the conﬁning rocks; well spacing and injection temperature are important parameters which inﬂuence transient heat transport in the subsurface porous media. Based on the simulations here a safe well spacing is proposed. The thermal energy produced by the system in two seasons is estimated for four different cases and strategy to avoid the premature thermal-breakthrough in critical cases is also discussed. The present numerical model results are validated using an analytical model and also compared with results from an experimental ﬁeld study performed at an ATES test site at Auburn University. The present model results agree with the analytical model very well and have been found to approximate the ﬁeld results quite well.},

The paper considers idealised doublet systems in faulted as well as unfaulted reservoir domains and studies the energy- and mass transport of simulated ATES systems. Five perennial loading/unloading series of solar thermal energy are investigated, assumed to be harvested by a hectare-sized ﬂat plate collector ﬁeld which is modeled employing climate data of the considered region.

The effects of stored volume and annual repetition on energy recovery are investigated. Recovery factors are evaluated for several different model setups and we find that storing 90 °C water at 2500 m depth is capable of reproducing, on average 67\% of the stored energy. In addition, ambient reservoir temperature of 75 °C is slightly elevated leading to increased efficiency. Additional simulations concerning pressure build-up in the reservoir are carried out to show that safety levels may not be reached. Reservoir characteristics are inspired by Danish geothermal conditions, but results are assumed to have more general validity. Thus, deep sedimentary reservoirs of suitable properties are found to be viable options for storing access energy for high-demand periods.},

	abstract = {We conducted a geoscientiﬁc feasibility study for the development of a high-temperature thermal aquifer energy storage system (HT-ATES) outside the capital of Muscat, northern Oman. The aquifer storage is part of a solargeothermal cooling project for the sustainable and continuous cooling of oﬃce buildings. The main concept is that excess solar energy will be stored in the subsurface through hot water injection and subsequently utilised as auxiliary energy source during peak demand times. The characterisation of aquifer heterogeneities is thus essential to predict subsurface thermal heat plume development and recovery eﬃciency of the storage system. We considered two aquifer systems as potential storage horizons, (i) a clastic-dominated alluvial fan system where individual channel systems in combination with diagenetic alterations constitute the main heterogeneities and (ii) a carbonate-dominated system represented by a homogenous layer-cake architecture. The feasibility study included a multidisciplinary approach from initial ﬁeld work, geocellular reservoir modelling to ﬁnite element ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal modelling. Our results show that for the HT-ATES system, with a high frequency of injection and production cycles, heat loss mainly occurs due to heterogeneities in the permeability ﬁeld of the aquifer in combination with buoyancy driven vertical ﬂuid ﬂow. An impermeable cap-rock is needed to keep the heat plume in place. Conductive heat loss is a minor issue. Highly complex heat plume geometries are apparent in the clastic channel system and ATES well planning is challenging due to the complex and interconnected highpermeable channels. The carbonate sequence shows uniform plume geometries due to the layer cake architecture of the system and is tentatively more suitable for ATES development. Based on our ﬁndings we propose the general concept of HT-ATES traps, incorporating and building on expertise and knowledge from petroleum and reservoir geology regarding reservoir rocks and suitable trap\&seal geometries. The concept can be used as guideline for future high-temperature aquifer storage exploration and development.},

	abstract = {To meet the global climate change mitigation targets, more attention has to be paid to the decarbonization of the heating and cooling sector. Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) is considered to bridge the gap between periods of highest energy demand and highest energy supply. The objective of this study therefore is to review the global application status of ATES underpinned by operational statistics from existing projects. ATES is particularly suited to provide heating and cooling for large-scale applications such as public and commercial buildings, district heating, or industrial purposes. Compared to conventional technologies, ATES systems achieve energy savings between 40\% and 70\% and CO2 savings of up to several thousand tons per year. Capital costs decline with increasing installed capacity, averaging 0.2 Mio. € for small systems and 2 Mio. € for large applications. The typical payback time is 2–10 years. Worldwide, there are currently more than 2800 ATES systems in operation, abstracting more than 2.5 TWh of heating and cooling per year. 99\% are low-temperature systems (LT-ATES) with storage temperatures of {\textless} 25 °C. 85\% of all systems are located in the Netherlands, and a further 10\% are found in Sweden, Denmark, and Belgium. However, there is an increasing interest in ATES technology in several countries such as Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Turkey, and China. The great discrepancy in global ATES development is attributed to several market barriers that impede market penetration. Such barriers are of socio-economic and legislative nature.},

Heterogeneous porous geothermal reservoir models considering the spatial distributions of permeability and rock heat capacity are generated. In total, 200 realizations with different permeability ﬁelds were considered. A fully coupled modeling of reservoir deformation, ﬂuid ﬂow, and heat transport was performed on each realization using the ﬁnite element method. The results showed that heterogeneity induced channeling appears in the geothermal reservoirs with increasing heterogeneity of permeability, through which the injected production can quickly reach the production well. This causes the shorter thermal breakthrough time at production wells, and the lower reservoir surface settlement. In geothermal reservoir models considering the correlation between heat capacity and permeability, the thermal breakthrough curves and the reservoir surface settlement were the same as the reservoir models of the constant heat capacity. With increasing correlation length, the possibility of ﬂow channels appearing in well pair system increases, causing a short average thermal breakthrough time and a lower surface settlement around the injection well. The existence of preferential ﬂow channels between injection and production wells indicates that an equivalent ﬂow channel model can be approximately simulate geothermal doublets in heterogeneous reservoirs.},

The intrinsic anisotropic permeability in the reservoir directly affects the path of ﬂow and the associated thermal drawdown from cooling procedure. Consequently, each individual component including thermal, hydraulic, and mechanical ﬁeld needs to be considered, to evaluate the inﬂuence of permeability anisotropy on the thermal production and evolution of rock properties. In this work, the fully implicit coupled simulator TFReact was successfully implemented to generate results prototypical of an enhanced geothermal system. Anisotropic permeability values were generated from the variation of fracture spacing at three orthogonal principal directions, with identical initial fracture aperture. Five case scenarios of permeability anisotropy were simulated to evaluate the inﬂuence of anisotropic thermal drawdown in triggering permeability evolution. Analysis of the propagation of the thermal front from injector to producer indicated that low anisotropic permeability values will lead to late cold water breakthrough at producer, slower migration rate and wider sweep area than high anisotropic permeability values. Isotropic permeability scenario showed a lower thermal gradient proﬁle, comparing against the scenarios of anisotropic permeability. The anisotropic value of 0.01 produced the highest power output, while isotropic permeability generated the least power output. Induced thermal stress resulted an unloading response by reducing compressive normal stress in sub-horizontal direction, and thereby increase fracture aperture in sub-horizontal direction. Invariably, the induced thermal expansion stress increased the compressive stress and reduced fracture aperture and permeability. After the same timing of injectionproduction cycle, the highest anisotropic permeability scenario resulted a factor of 2.5 increment in evolving fracture permeability, while lowest anisotropic permeability scenario lead to a factor of 0.35 decrease in changing fracture permeability. The generated thermal output suggested the most favorable strategy in maximizing thermal sweep across the reservoir, by prompting thermal transfer normal to direction of injector-producer.},

Image features obtained by using these two pre-processing methods were then used as inputs for two regression algorithms: Gaussian Process Regression and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks. The methods were evaluated by using a laboratory-scale ﬂatﬂame burner and a pilot-scale entrained ﬂow biomass gasiﬁer. For the ﬂat-ﬂame burner, the root mean square error (RMSE) were on the order of the uncertainty of the experimental measurements. For the gasiﬁer, the RMSE was approximately three times higher than the experimental uncertainty – however, the main source of the error was the quantization of the training dataset. The accuracy of the predictions was found to be suﬃcient for process monitoring purposes. As a feature extraction step, reduction to statistical moments proved to be superior compared to pixel binning.},

	abstract = {Pyrolysis of biomass in a rotary kiln ﬁnds application both as an intermediate step in multistage gasiﬁcation as well as a process on its own for the production of biochar. In this work, a numerical model for pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass in a rotary kiln is developed. The model is based on a set of conservation equations for mass and energy, combined with independent submodels for the pyrolysis reaction, heat transfer, and granular ﬂow inside the kiln. The pyrolysis reaction is described by a two-step mechanism where biomass decays into gas, char, and tar that subsequently undergo further reactions; the heat transfer model accounts for conduction, convection and radiation inside the kiln; and the granular ﬂow model is described by the well known Saeman model. The model is compared to experimental data obtained from a pilot scale rotary kiln pyrolyzer. In total 9 pilot plant trials at different feed ﬂow rate and different heat supply were run. For moderate heat supplies we found good agreement between the model and the experiments while deviations were seen at high heat supply. Using the model to simulate various operation conditions reveals a strong interplay between heat transfer and granular ﬂow which both are controlled by the kiln rotation speed. Also, the model indicates the importance of heat losses and lays the foundation for scale up calculations and process optimization.},

	abstract = {The biomass for entrained-ﬂow gasiﬁcation needs to be pretreated to signiﬁcantly increase its heating value and to make it more readily transportable. The pyrolysis pretreatment was conducted in a lab scale ﬁxed-bed reactor; the reactor was heated to elevate the temperature at 5 °C/min before holding at the desired pyrolysis temperature for 1.5 h a ﬁxed time. The effects of pyrolysis temperature on the yield, composition and heating value of the gaseous, liquid and solid products were determined. The pyrolysis removed most oxygenated constituents of rice straw while signiﬁcantly increased its energy density. Meantime, it changes the physical properties of biomass powders. The results show that the angle of repose, the angle of internal friction of semi-char decrease obviously; the bulk density of semi-char is bigger than that of biomass. This could favor the feeding of biomass. Considering yield and heating value of the solid semi-char product and the feeding problem, the best pyrolysis temperature was 400 °C. The results of this study have conﬁrmed the feasibility of employing pyrolyzed biomass for entrained-ﬂow gasiﬁcation; they are useful for the additional studies that will be necessary for designing an efﬁcient biomass entrained-ﬂow gasiﬁcation system.},

	abstract = {Reactive flow through fractures results in dissolution/precipitation of minerals and thus alteration in fracture apertures/opening, affecting the flow paths in the fracture. Backed by laboratory experiments, the openings in fracture due to dissolution are most likely not stable under confining stresses, resulting in closure of fractures. In this research, a novel method to couple Thermal-Hydraulic-Mechanical (THM) with Chemical (C) processes is presented, capable of capturing the aperture closure under in situ stresses during heat withdrawal from an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS). The dissolution process of silica is considered, resulting in a relatively uniform aperture increase in the fracture prior to applying the in situ stresses. Then, the mechanical equilibrium is solved and the final apertures are computed from the updated contact stresses on fracture surfaces. Due to the matrix compliance, in most cases the closure of the apertures induced by the uniform dissolution of silica has been observed. The results are compared against a case where the mechanical equilibrium after the dissolution process is not considered (i.e. one-way coupling of THM and C). Without mechanical feedback on the dissolution apertures, the flow in the fracture is dominated by dissolution apertures, also affecting the heat production from EGS. However, after applying in situ stresses, the effect of dissolution apertures on the heat production is diminished. Depending on the compliance of the matrix, the size of the fracture and the size of dissolution opening, the stresses are redistributed to satisfy the mechanical equilibrium, affecting the aperture distribution over the fracture.},

Due to the fractures’ characteristics as approximately planar discontinuities with an extreme size-to-width ratio, they challenge standard macroscale mathematical and numerical modeling of ﬂow based on averaging. Thus, over the last decades, various, and also fundamentally different, modeling approaches have been developed. This paper reviews common conceptual models and discretization approaches for ﬂow in fractured porous media, with an emphasis on the dominating effects the fractures have on ﬂow processes. In this context, the paper discusses the tight connection between physical and mathematical modeling and simulation approaches. Extensions and research challenges related to transport, multi-phase ﬂow and ﬂuid-solid interaction are also commented on.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on the simulation techniques being developed in recent years for describing unique ﬂow behaviors in shale and tight gas reservoirs. The advances in modeling gas ﬂow and transport mechanisms during the primary and enhanced gas recovery processes are reviewed in detail. The capabilities of reservoir simulation tools are discussed in terms of mathematical treatment (ﬁnite difference, ﬁnite element, explicit/implicit scheme, sequentially and fully coupled schemes), ﬂuid ﬂow characteristics (Darcy and non-Darcy ﬂow, desorption, Klinkenberg effect and gas slip ﬂow, transitional ﬂow, Knudsen diffusion), reservoir rock properties (pore size distribution, fractures, geomechanics), multidisciplinary coupling scheme (THM, THC, THMC), modeling scale, and computational efﬁciency. For pore-scale modeling of gas ﬂow and transport in unconventional reservoir rocks, the numerical methods for generating pore network models and the procedure for constructing real 3D digital rocks are ﬁrst explained. Then, the network modeling methods used for simulating slip and transitional ﬂows in pore networks are introduced and compared. After that, existing latticeBoltzmann models developed for slip ﬂow simulation are illustrated. Along with the explanation, pros and cons of the models for pore-scale modeling have been identiﬁed. Overall, dwelling on the concerns and challenges in shale and tight gas reservoir simulation, current status, progress and bottlenecks of numerical simulation technologies are discussed and perspectives on future development of unconventional gas reservoir simulators are proposed.},

	abstract = {There is wide concern that ﬂuid injection in the subsurface, such as for the stimulation of shale reservoirs or for geological CO2 sequestration (GCS), has the potential to induce seismicity that may change reservoir permeability due to fault slip. However, the impact of induced seismicity on fracture permeability evolution remains unclear due to the spectrum of modes of fault reactivation (e.g., stable versus unstable). As seismicity is controlled by the frictional response of fractures, we explore friction-stability-permeability relationships through the concurrent measurement of frictional and hydraulic properties of artiﬁcial fractures in Green River shale (GRS) and Opalinus shale (OPS). We observe that carbonate-rich GRS shows higher frictional strength but weak neutral frictional stability. The GRS fracture permeability declines during shearing while an increased sliding velocity reduces the rate of permeability decline. By comparison, the phyllosilicate-rich OPS has lower friction and strong stability while the fracture permeability is reduced due to the swelling behavior that dominates over the shearing induced permeability reduction. Hence, we conclude that the friction-stability-permeability relationship of a fracture is largely controlled by mineral composition and that shale mineral compositions with strong frictional stability may be particularly subject to permanent permeability reduction during ﬂuid inﬁltration.},

The ﬁeld data that are reviewed include in situ block experiments, excavation-induced changes in permeability around tunnels, borehole injection experiments, depth (and stress) dependent permeability, and permeability changes associated with a large-scale rock-mass heating experiment. Data show how the stresspermeability relationship of fractured rock very much depends on local in situ conditions, such as fracture shear offset and fracture inﬁlling by mineral precipitation. Field and laboratory experiments involving temperature have shown signiﬁcant temperature-driven fracture closure even under constant stress. Such temperature-driven fracture closure has been described as thermal overclosure and relates to better ﬁtting of opposing fracture surfaces at high temperatures, or is attributed to chemically mediated fracture closure related to pressure solution (and compaction) of stressed fracture surface asperities. Back-calculated stress-permeability relationships from ﬁeld data may implicitly account for such effects, but the relative contribution of purely thermal-mechanical and chemically mediated changes is difﬁcult to isolate. Therefore, it is concluded that further laboratory and in situ experiments are needed to increase the knowledge of the true mechanisms behind thermally driven fracture closure, and to further assess the importance of chemical-mechanical coupling for the long-term evolution of fractured rock permeability.},

Linear diffusion models do a reasonably good job of constraining the front of the stimulated region because of the t1/2 dependence of the perturbation length, but triggering pressures resulting from such models, and the permeability inferred using the diffusivity parameter, drastically underestimate both permeability and pressure changes. This leads to incorrect interpretations about the nature of the system, including the degree of ﬂuid pressures needed to induce seismicity required to enhance the system. Here, I use a minimalist approach to modeling and show that all of the observations from Basel (Switzerland) ﬂuid injection experiment are well matched by a simple model where the dominant control on the system is a large-scale change in permeability at the onset of slip. The excellent agreement between observations and these simplest of models indicates that these systems may be less complicated than envisaged, thus offering strategies for more sophisticated future modeling to help constrain and exploit these systems.},

	abstract = {Thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical simulations at the pore scale are conducted to study the hydraulic sealing of siliciclastic rock fractures as contact zones grow driven by pressure dissolution. The evolving ﬂuid-saturated three-dimensional pore space of the fracture results from the elastic contact between self-aﬃne, randomly rough surfaces in response to the eﬀective conﬁning pressure. A diﬀusion-reaction equation controls pressure solution over contact zones as a function of their emergent geometry and stress variations. Results show that three coupled processes govern the evolution of the fracture’s hydraulic properties: (1) the dissolution-driven convergence of the opposing fracture walls acts to compact the pore space; (2) the growth of contact zones reduces the elastic compression of the pore space; and (3) the growth of contact zones leads to ﬂow channeling and the presence of stagnant zones in the ﬂow ﬁeld. The dominant early time compaction mechanism is the elastic compression of the fracture void space, but this eventually becomes overshadowed by the irreversible process of pressure dissolution. Growing contact zones isolate void space and cause an increasing disproportion between average and hydraulic aperture. This results in the loss of hydraulic conductivity when the mean aperture is a third of its initial value and the contact ratio approaches the characteristic value of one half. Convergence rates depend on small-wavelength roughness initially and on long-wavelength roughness in the late time. The assumption of a characteristic roughness length scale, therefore, leads to a characteristic time scale with an underestimation of dissolution rates before and an overestimation thereafter.},

Calcite being a more reactive mineral than other rock minerals composing the earth curst, we investigate the permeability alteration during geothermal heat production from carbonate reservoirs. In this study the simulations are performed using the code FEHM with coupled thermo-hydro-chemical (THC) capabilities for a three dimensional domain. The computational domain consists of a single fracture connecting the injection and production wells. For reactive alteration of aperture, the model considers that the kinetics of dissolution/precipitation is coupled to the equilibrium interactions among the aqueous species/ions. The reaction rate predominantly depends on the temperature dependent solubility and advective–dispersive solute transport in the fracture. Due to the nonuniform ﬂow ﬁelds resulting from injection and production, the coupled thermo-hydro-chemical processes initiate signiﬁcant variation of the aperture alteration rate over the fracture. We have considered different operating conditions such as different mass injection rate, injection temperature and concentration of minerals. Our simulations show that dissolution and precipitation can occur simultaneously at different locations in fracture. Furthermore the reaction rate varies with time and the reaction rate can also switch between dissolution and precipitation. To illustrate this interesting behavior, the variations of shape and size of zero reaction rate contours with time are shown. An interesting outcome is a non-monotonic evolution of the overall transmissivity between the wells. The alteration of overall transmissivity largely depends on the concentration of mineral in the injected water with respect to the solubility at the initial fracture temperature. For both dissolution and precipitation controlled cases, the rapid changes in transmissivity provide challenges for maintaining circulation of water at constant mass ﬂow rate.},

	abstract = {Coupled thermo-poro-chemo-mechanical processes in geothermal systems impact the reservoir response during injection and production procedures by affecting fracture permeability. A threedimensional numerical model is presented to analyze these processes during ﬂuid injection into geothermal reservoirs. The solid mechanics aspect of the problem is computed using the displacement discontinuity boundary element method (BEM) while transport processes within the facture are modeled using the ﬁnite element method (FEM). The FEM and BEM formulations are integrated to set up a system of equations for unknown temperature, pressure, concentration, and fracture aperture. The ﬂuid diffusion, heat conduction and solute diffusion in the reservoir are treated using BEM so that the need of inﬁnite reservoir domain discretization is eliminated. The numerical model is used to analyze the fracture response to non-isothermal reactive ﬂow in EGS. Numerical examples of SiO2 undersaturated-cold water injection into the geothermal reservoir show that silica dissolves from the rock matrix, increasing the fracture aperture. The zone of silica dissolution spreads into the fracture with continuous ﬂuid injection. At large injection times, thermoelastic stress has a greater impact on fracture aperture compared to poroelastic stress. Simulations that consider natural fracture stiffness heterogeneity show the development of a non-uniform ﬂow path within the crack, with lower rock matrix cooling and thus enhanced silica reactivity in the high stiffness regions. As a result, areas of higher joint normal stiffness show lower aperture increases in response to the thermo-poroelastic processes, but a higher aperture expansion due to silica dissolution. Depending on the injectate saturation state with respect to quartz, silica is added or removed from the rock matrix. This process is likely to impact the rock matrix properties and its mechanical response to stress perturbations associated with ﬂuid circulation.},

	abstract = {Principal mechanical and chemical processes contributing to the observed spontaneous switching from net decrease in permeability to net increase in a fracture in carbonate are examined. The evolution of permeability, and related fracture aperture, is represented through a lumped parameter model. The signiﬁcant processes of pressure solution beneath bridging asperities, transport of dissolved mass to the fracture void, and subsequent precipitation or dissolution within the fracture void enable the principal characteristics of observed behavior to be followed. The evolution of dissolved mass concentration in the pore ﬂuid is followed for arbitrary applied stress, temperature, and pH conditions, with appropriate feedback to the evolution of fracture permeability. Comparisons with experimental measurements in limestone (Polak et al., 2004, Water Resour. Res. Vol. 40, W03502, doi: 10.1029/2003GL017575) show satisfactory agreement for the evolution of fracture aperture and to a lesser degree in calcium concentrations in the efﬂuent pore ﬂuid. Importantly, the spontaneous switching in permeability change, from aperture reducing to aperture increasing, with no change in environmental conditions, is replicated without the need for an ad hoc trigger. Although this switch is accurately replicated, the lumped parameter model is incapable of replicating the rapid observed growth in permeability that directly follows. This inability results from the assumed form of the lumped asperity model, that is incapable of representing the spatially distributed change in aperture that is seen to occur within the fracture. Despite this inconsistency, the model is shown capable of representing the principal behaviors evident in the response.},

	abstract = {We report flow-through experiments on a natural fracture in novaculite under moderate effective stresses (∼ 1.4 MPa) and temperatures (20–120 °C) to examine the effect on flow and transport characteristics. The efflux of fluid and dissolved minerals were measured throughout the 3150-h experiment. After the experiment the fracture was imaged by X-ray CT, impregnated with Wood's metal, and a cast recovered of the Wood's metal-filled fracture. These measurements constrain the evolution of fracture structure, and the change in permeability that resulted from stress- and temperature-dependent dissolution at both propping asperities and fracture void surfaces. During the first 1500 h, the aperture of one fracture decreased from 18.5 to 7.5 μm, when it was loaded with constant effective stress of 1.4 MPa, at room temperature, and a flow rate decreasing with time from 1 to 0.0625 mL/min. This reduction is attributed to the removal of mineral mass from bridging asperities. After 1500 h the fracture aperture increased, ultimately reaching 13 μm. Apparently the dominant dissolution process switched from prop removal to etching of the void surfaces. We used X-ray CT images, digital radiographs, and fracture casts as independent methods to constrain the resulting architecture of the evolved fracture porosity, and developed a simple process-based model to examine the relative roles of asperity removal and free-face dissolution. The comparison of the model with the measurements identifies the relative importance of mass removal at fracture faces and at propping asperities. The experiments underscore the importance of dissolution in determining the sense, the rates and the magnitude of permeability-enhancement within rock fractures stimulated by chemical permeants in geothermal and petroleum reservoirs, and to a lesser degree under natural conditions pushed far-from-equilibrium.},

In this study, the codes are sequentially executed and linked through external coupling modules: one that dictates changes in effective stress as a function of multi-phase pore pressure and thermal expansion, and one that corrects porosity, permeability, and capillary pressure for changes in stress.

The DECOVALEX project (DEvelopment of COupled models and their VALidation against EXperiments) was established and maintained by a variety of waste management organisations, regulators and research organisations to help improve capabilities in experimental interpretation, numerical modelling and blind prediction of complex coupled systems. In the present round of DECOVALEX (D-2015), one component of Task C1 has considered the detailed experimental work of Yasuhara et al. (Earth Planet Sci Lett 244:186–200, 2006), wherein a single artificial fracture in novaculite (micro- or crypto-crystalline quartz) is subject to variable fluid flows, mechanical confining pressure and different applied temperatures. This paper presents a synthesis of the completed work of six separate research teams. A range of approaches are presented including 2D and 3D high-resolution coupled thermo–hydro–mechanical–chemical models. The results of the work show that while good, physically plausible representations of the experiment can be obtained using a range of approaches, there is considerable uncertainty in the relative importance of the various processes, and that the parameterisation of these processes can be closely linked to the interpretation of the fracture surface topography at different spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Fluid migration in the subsurface has the potential to induce changes in fluid pressure distribution, temperature distribution, mechanical stresses and the chemistry of both the fluid and the natural geological material it is flowing through. In many situations, the change in all of these processes gives a coupled response, in that one process feeds back to another. When trying to understand fluid flow through naturally and artificially fractured systems, it is important to be able to identify the relative importance of the processes occurring and the degree of interactions between them. Modelling of such highly nonlinear coupled flow is complex. Current and predicted computational ability is not able to simulate discretely all the known and physically described processes operating. One approach to coping with this complexity is to identify the relative importance and impact of relevant processes, dependent on the application of interest. Addressing such complexity can be particularly important when the characteristics of natural and disturbed geological materials are being evaluated in the context of disposal of radioactive waste or other geo-engineering systems where an understanding of the long-term evolution is required. Based on a series of coupled (THMC—Thermal, Hydraulic, Mechanical and Chemical) experimental investigations on the flow of fluid through fractured novaculite and granite crystalline rock samples, several couplings are examined where there is both a significant kinetic chemical control as well as mechanical and temperature control on the fluid flow behaviour. These interactions can be shown both in the literature and experimentally to have a significant effect on the rate of fluid flow through fractures. A new discrete numerical approach and a new homogenous approach are used to model the experimental results of coupled flow through fractures. The results of these modelling approaches are benchmarked both against one another and against the experimental results, and then the processes included in the approaches are ranked in order of impact.},

	abstract = {Fluid–mineral interaction has an irreversible impact on the fracture permeability evolution in the life span of deep geological reservoirs. To investigate the impact, a preliminary study on water–granite interaction in an undeformable fracture under confining pressure is conducted. A 1-D flow and reactive transport model is therefore developed and validated against the experimental data in Yasuhara et al. (Appl Geochem 26(12):2074–2088, 2011). The model takes free-face dissolution on pore walls as well as enhanced dissolution at asperity contacts into account, together with a nested well-equipped geochemical system. The simulation is implemented by FEM-based simulator OpenGeoSys with a plugin module of IPhreeqc for speciation calculation. After calibration, the predictions of effluent element concentrations are in good agreement with the measurements. The study indicates the high effluent concentrations arise from enhanced mineral dissolution at asperity contacts. Pressure solution at anorthite contacts may not take effect under experimental conditions because of the high-level energy barrier to interpenetration, and Al-bearing secondary minerals such as gibbsite may be formed in the current near-equilibrium aqueous system. The sensitivity analysis suggests that contact area ratio is a paramount parameter in determining the surface reactivity and reactive surface area at contacts.},

	abstract = {An approach for simulating thermal, hydraulic, mechanical and chemical (THMC) coupled processes in single rock fractures has been developed under the framework of a self-developed numerical method, i.e., an elasto-plastic cellular automaton. The balance equations of multi-physics problems to describe the THMC process in single rock fracture are solved by using cellular automaton technique on space scale and finite difference method on time scale, respectively. Using the concept of cellular automaton, a single rock fracture surface is discretized into a system composed of cell elements. Different apertures, i.e., 0 for contact and nonzero for void, are assigned to each cell element based on the fracture surface topography. The fluid flow, stress-dependent chemical reaction and solute transport are simulated by using a cellular automaton updating rule, in which only local cell balance equation is considered. The contribution of cell elements in contact to cell’s transmissivity and convection can be ignored conveniently. The Lagrangian method is used to simulate the particle transport. Special treatment for particle transport to outer boundaries and internal boundaries is adopted. As a result, the local behaviors, such as the formation of local contact, dead ends in the fracture and the local aperture change, are conveniently updated dynamically. The approach is used to simulate the coupled THMC process in a single novaculite fracture. The behaviors of pressure dissolution caused by effective stress, free-face dissolution/precipitation, thermal-dependent fluid flow and ion transport are well reproduced by using the developed approach, subject to parameter calibration. The robustness of the general approach to such complex problems is demonstrated by comparing with experimental data.},

	abstract = {In many subsurface engineering geoscience applications the impact of thermal, hydraulic, mechanical and chemical (THMC) processes needs to be evaluated. Coupled process models require solution of the partial differential equations describing energy or mass balance. Ignoring the coupling of these processes can lead to a significant oversimplification which may not adequately represent the systems being modelled. Incorporation of coupled processes and associated phenomena inevitably leads to numerical stability issues due to very different scales in terms of spatial distribution, time and parametrical heterogeneity. One approach to simplify the computational demands is to integrate analytical and physical models into standard numerical modelling techniques (in this case finite elements), effectively adding sub-grid scale and sub-time scale information to the model. We present such an approach for the simulation of fluid flow through a fracture validated against experimental data and cross comparison with results of other modelling teams within the DECOVALEX 2015 (development of coupled models and their validation against experiments) project (http://www.decovalex.org). By replacing the mechanical behaviour and chemical transport processes with physical models, and by utilising the static nature of the temperature changes, only the hydraulic system required numerical solution in a highly coupled problem. Physical models for fracture closure due to pressure solution, fracture opening due to chemical dissolution, the development of channel flow and a change in the reactive transport characteristics with time were implemented and are described here. The main features of the experimental data could be replicated, although lying outside of the parameter range suggested by the literature. Comparison with other teams using different modelling approaches indicated internal consistency.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a pioneering approach of reactive transport in porous media is introduced, which model thermal–hydraulic–mechanical–chemical processes. The novelties of this approach are: (i) non-equilibrium thermodynamics which is used as a unifying framework relating generalized ﬂuxes to forces and (ii) fully coupled integration of the multiphysics processes, introduced within the framework of large transformations including logarithmic ﬁnite strain and co-rotational rates. This formulation opens the horizons for complex simulations which were difﬁcult to conduct previously because of the lacking bridges between non-linear computational mechanics and reactive transport processes. As an illustration of the model, a sample of simple geometry is subjected to a non-linear deformation beyond the reversible regime. This perturbation from equilibrium produces a permanent deformation, an overpressure and a temperature change. The subsequent thermodynamic conditions trigger chemical reactions among the aqueous species which are not necessarily in equilibrium with their environment. The deformation also induces a change of porosity which affects the permeability as well as the pore pressure distribution.},

Speciﬁcally, the chemo-mechanical process of the pressure solution was incorporated into the model. The developed model was validated by replicating the existing experimental measurements of the porosity reduction and the evolving silica concentration. Subsequently, by simulating the burial of high-level radioactive wastes in the deep subsurface, namely, by applying the simulated conﬁning pressure and temperature conditions, the long-term evolution of the rock permeability was predicted. The model predictions clearly showed a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the pressure dissolution on the change in permeability with time. The predicted permeability of the rocks close to the wastes decreased by one order of magnitude in 104 years when considering the pressure dissolution, while the permeability changed little during the same period when the pressure dissolution was not considered. This reduction should delay the dispersion of the radioactive materials dissolved in the groundwater.},

	abstract = {One of the most important design variables for a geological nuclear waste repository is the temperature limit up to which the engineered barrier system (EBS) and the natural geologic environment can be exposed. Up to now, almost all design concepts that involve bentonite-backﬁlled emplacement tunnels have chosen a maximum allowable temperature of about 100 °C. Such a choice is largely based on the consideration that in clay-based materials illitization and the associated mechanical changes in the bentonite (and perhaps the clay host rock) could affect the barrier attributes of the EBS. However, existing experimental and modeling studies on the occurrence of illitization and related performance impacts are not conclusive, in part because the relevant couplings between the thermal, hydrological, chemical, and mechanical (THMC) processes have not been fully represented in the models. This paper presents a fully coupled THMC simulation of a nuclear waste repository in a clay formation with a bentonite-backﬁlled EBS for 1000 years. Two scenarios were simulated for comparison: a case in which the temperature in the bentonite near the waste canister can reach about 200 °C and a case in which the temperature in the bentonite near the waste canister peaks at about 100 °C.},

	abstract = {The importance of thermal-hydrological-mechanical-chemical (THMC) interactions is well recognized in the procedure of CO2 geo-sequestration. Geo-mechanics and geo-chemistry may have signiﬁcant effects on the aqueous phase composition, porosity and permeability of the formation, which in turn affect ﬂow and transport processes. Using a mean stress formulation, geomechanical effects are considered such as stresses, displacements, and rock deformation in CO2 sequestration. Chemical equilibrium and kinetics are taken into account in the mass balance equation, which is able to quantitatively simulate ﬂuid ﬂow, solute transport and geoechemical reaction in the operation of CO2 geo-sequestration. Since rock strength decreases with increasing amounts of reactive minerals, substantial dissolution/precipitation of rock composition may lead to signiﬁcant changes in the mechanical behavior, a generic computational scheme has been developed to take the mechanical and chemical coupling effects into account. Based on these theories, a novel mathematical model of the THMC processes is developed in this paper. A fully coupled computational framework is proposed and used to simulate reactive transport of water, CO2 gas and species in subsurface formation with geomechanics. The novel frameworks are designed to keep a generalized computational structure for different THMC processes. The coupled THMC simulators focus on: (1) ﬂuid and heat ﬂow, solute transport in a three-phase mixture, (2) stress and displacement related to mean stress, (3) non-isothermal effects on ﬂuid properties and reaction processes, and (4) the equilibrium and kinetics of water-rock and gas-rock chemical interactions. A practical reactive transport examples with cold supercritical CO2 injection into saline aquifer has been proposed to analyze the THMC processes quantitatively. It is indicated that the geochemical reactions do not have signiﬁcant impact on pore pressure, mean stress and temperature. The thermal energy transport with low temperature signiﬁcantly affects the mean stress and geochemical reactions in the saline aquifer. Low temperature accelerates equilibrium dissolution of gas and mineral, but slows down kinetic dissolution/ precipitation of minerals, such as anorthite and kaolinite.},

The injection performance and flow paths are dominated by the permeability distribution of fracture network for EGS reservoirs. The evolution of reservoir permeability can be affected by rock deformation, induced by the change in temperature or pressure around the injector, and chemical reactions between injection fluid and reservoir rock minerals. Thus the change in permeability due to geomechanical deformation and mineral precipitation/dissolution could have a major impact on reservoir long-term performance.

Simulations of the field tests were performed using TOUGHREACT V3-OMP (Sonnenthal et al., unpublished) and TOUGHREACT-ROCMECH (Kim et al., 2012; THMC code). In addition to full multiphase reactive-transport capabilities, TOUGHREACT-ROCMECH also couples thermohydromechanical rock deformation (poroelasticity), shear and tensile failure, with coupling to porosity and permeability changes. Simulations captured the detailed in-situ temperature profiles and wellhead pressures, as well as the effects thought to have resulted in the overall spatial distribution of microseismicity. The refined 3-D model was then used as a basis to evaluate processes and planning for the 2014 Stimulation Test. Starting in September 2014, injection into Well 55-29 was repeated after installation of a new casing and a perforated liner in the open well section. The THM model has captured the approximately 4-fold increase in injection rates quite closely, as well as the spatial distribuion of permeability increases and pressure changes.},

We identify key length scales for Earth systems processes and ﬁnd a substantial scale separation between chemical, hydrous and thermal diffusion. We propose that this allows a simpliﬁed two-scale analysis where the outputs from the micro-scale model can be used as inputs for meso-scale simulations, which then in turn becomes the micro-model for the next scale up. We present two fundamental theoretical approaches to link the scales through asymptotic homogenisation from a macroscopic thermodynamic view and percolation renormalisation from a microscopic, statistical mechanics view.},

In particular, the model was employed for the purpose of describing the evolution of permeability and reactive transport behavior within rock fractures by taking into account the geochemical processes of the free-face dissolution and the pressure dissolution. In order to examine the capability of the developed model, the model was applied to replicate the experimental measurements of the evolution in hydraulic aperture, permeability, and element concentrations obtained from two ﬂow-through experiments using single granite and mudstone fractures. The model predictions for the granite experiment were able to follow the actual data for the evolution in hydraulic aperture and eﬄuent element concentrations without adopting any ﬁtting parameters that are often used in other THMC coupled models obtained from literature. Furthermore, the model succeeded in replicating the actual changes in fracture permeability and eﬄuent element concentrations within the mudstone fracture. Although some uncertain mismatches between the experiments and the model predictions, such as changes in the concentrations of several elements (i.e., Na and K concentrations in the granite fracture and Al in the mudstone fracture) were remaining at this stage, the developed model should be valid for evaluating the evolution in the ﬂuid ﬂow and mass transport behavior within rock fractures induced by mineral dissolution under stress- and temperature-controlled conditions.},

Firstly, the hydrochemical and hydraulic erosion equations were established. The equations of the coupled THC model were established by combining the hydrochemical and hydraulic erosion equations, the ﬂow equations, and the heat transfer equations. Weibull distribution was adopted to govern the heterogeneity of initial rock porosity distribution. Secondly, the inﬂuence of the hydrochemistry, the temperature and the initial porosity heterogeneity on porosity and ﬂuid velocity change was studied. Then the rock damage rule changed with time at diﬀerent pH values and temperature was studied. Finally, an actual deep coal mine model was established to apply the THC model to predict water inrush. Results indicate that: (1) The average porosity and average ﬂuid velocity approximately show linear growth and exponential growth with time, respectively, and their growth rates increase with decreasing pH value and increasing temperature in a certain acidity and temperature range. (2) The increase of initial porosity heterogeneity has little inﬂuence on porosity change, but it can increase the ﬂuid velocity growth rate. The porosity heterogeneity and ﬂuid velocity heterogeneity approximately show exponential growth with increasing time, and the rock heterogeneity growth contributes to form cracks. The increase of temperature and decrease of pH value have little inﬂuence on the porosity heterogeneity, but they can increase the growth rate of the ﬂuid velocity heterogeneity. (3) The rock damage shows linear growth with time, and its growth rate increases with decreasing pH value and increasing temperature in a certain acidity range and temperature range. (4) The increase of rock heterogeneity can increase the possibility of water inrush.},

The main goal of the interface is to maximize the synergies between the aforementioned codes, providing a numerical platform that can efﬁciently simulate a wide number of multiphysics problems coupled with geochemistry. iCP is written in Java and uses the IPhreeqc C þ þ dynamic library and the COMSOL Java-API. Given the large computational requirements of the aforementioned coupled models, special emphasis has been placed on numerical robustness and efﬁciency. To this end, the geochemical reactions are solved in parallel by balancing the computational load over multiple threads. First, a benchmark exercise is used to test the reliability of iCP regarding ﬂow and reactive transport. Then, a large scale thermo-hydro-chemical (THC) problem is solved to show the code capabilities. The results of the veriﬁcation exercise are successfully compared with those obtained using PHREEQC and the application case demonstrates the scalability of a large scale model, at least up to 32 threads.},

	abstract = {Injection-induced seismicity has become a major barrier to the development of geothermal energy, because the complexity of fault behaviors and the lack of physical fundamentals make it extremely difficult to assess, predict, and control during geothermal energy extraction. The motivations of this review include, (1) to identify the recent advances in understanding and modelling of coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), and (2) to apply the THMC processes for improving our ability to predict the occurrence of the anthropogenic earthquakes. Fault activation is associated with several processes, including pore pressure diffusion, temperature alteration and stress-aided corrosion, and can be simulated by pore-scale modelling. However, there is still a rudimentary understanding of how these processes fit together with the spatial and temporal distribution of the induced earthquakes. Uncertainty in the seismic moment prediction, such as the interaction between the reservoir operations and fault responses, hinders the development of EGS. The current challenges in the earthquake prediction include the quantification of stress state, complexity of reservoir structure, and proper strategy of fluid injection. Cyclic soft stimulation and borehole seismometer feedback have been successfully used to mitigate the risks associated with fluid injection. Nevertheless, in some circumstances, the activation of nearby blind, critically stressed faults is uncontrollable, no matter how much fluid is injected into the reservoir.},

We present a novel numerical model to describe the spatial THMC interactions and to better understand the process interactions that control the evolution of permeability and the heat transfer area. The permeability and porosity evolution accommodate changes driven by thermo-hydro-mechanical compaction/dilation and mineral precipitation/dissolution. Mechanical and hydraulic effects are demonstrated to exert a small and short-term influence on permeability change, while the thermal effects are manifest in the intermediate and short-term influence. The most significant and long-term influence on permeability change is by chemical effects, where decreases in fracture permeability may be of the order of 10
              -5
              due to calcite precipitation in fracture throats, which causes the overall permeability to reduce to 70\% of the initial permeability. The initial pressure and temperature of the injected CO
              2
              exerts an overriding influence on permeability. In particular, an increased temperature reduces the mineral precipitation in the fracture and enhances mineral dissolution within the matrix and pore but results in mechanical closure of the fractures. Optimizing injection pressure and temperature may allow the minimization of precipitation and the maximization of heat recovery.},

The combined inﬂuence of stress-driven asperity dissolution, thermal-hydro-mechanical asperity compaction/dilation, and mineral precipitation/ dissolution alter the permeability of fractures during thermal, hydraulic, and chemical stimulation. Fracture and matrix are mechanically linked through linear, dual-porosity poroelasticity. Stressdissolution effects are driven by augmented effective stresses incrementally deﬁned at steady state with feedbacks to the transport system as a mass source, and to the mechanical system as an equivalent chemical strain. Porosity, permeability, stiffness, and chemical composition may be spatially heterogeneous and evolve with local temperature, effective stress and chemical potential. Changes in total stress generate undrained ﬂuid pressure increments which are passed from the mechanical analysis to the transport logic with a correction to enforce conservation of ﬂuid mass. Analytical comparisons conﬁrm the ability of the model to represent the rapid, undrained response of the ﬂuidmechanical system to mechanical loading. We then focus on a full thermal loading/unloading cycle of a constrained fractured mass and follow irreversible alteration in in-situ stress and permeability resulting from both mechanical and chemical effects.

The model is applied to the potential Newberry EGS ﬁeld (USA) by assuming fracture sizes of 10–1200 m. Models are classiﬁed by their conceptualization of the fractured reservoir geometry as networks of discrete fractures and with equivalent fractured media as ﬁll-in. The THMC model is applied to a doublet injector-producer to explore the spatial and temporal triggering of seismicity for varied fracture network geometries both shallow (2000 m) and at depth (2750 m). The magnitude of the resulting seismic events is in the range −2 to +1.9. The largest event size (∼1.9) corresponds to the largest fracture size (∼1200 m) within the reservoir. The rate of hydraulic and thermal transport has a considerable inﬂuence on the amount, location, and timing of failure, and ultimately, on the event rate. The event rate is highest when the fracture density is highest (0.9 m−1) and the initial stresses highest (at depth). In all cases, the a-value decreases and the b-value increases with time. The b-value is largest (∼1.34) for the highest fracture density and the highest stress regime. Thermal energy recovered during production is also greatest at depth and for the highest density of fractures.},

Int J Rock Mech Min Sci 2009; doi:10.1016/j.ijrmms.2009.01.008] we introduced a new methodology and numerical simulator for the modeling of thermal–hydrologic–mechanical–chemical processes in dual-porosity media. In this paper we utilize the model to examine some of the dominant behaviors and permeability-altering mechanisms that may operate in naturally fractured media. Permeability and porosity are modiﬁed as fracture apertures dilate or contract under the inﬂuence of pressure solution, thermo–hydromechanical compaction/dilation, and mineral precipitation/dissolution. We examine a prototypical enhanced geothermal system (EGS) for the relative, temporal arrival of hydro-mechanical vs. thermomechanical vs. chemical changes in ﬂuid transmission as cold (70 1C) water is injected at geochemical disequilibrium within a heated reservoir (275 1C). For an injection-withdrawal doublet separated by \$670 m, the results demonstrate the strong inﬂuence of mechanical effects in the short-term (several days), the inﬂuence of thermal effects in the intermediate term (o1 month at injection), and the prolonged and long-term (41 year) inﬂuence of chemical effects, especially close to injection. In most of the reservoir, cooling enhances permeability and increases ﬂuid circulation under pressure-drive. We observe thermo-mechanical driven permeability enhancement in front of the advancing thermal sweep, counteracted by the re-precipitation of minerals previously dissolved into the cool injection water. Near injection, calcite dissolution is capable of increasing permeability by nearly an order of magnitude, while precipitation of amorphous silica onsets more slowly and can completely counteract this increase over the very long-term (410 years). For the reinjection of highly-silica-saturated water, amorphous silica is capable of drastic reduction in permeability close to the injection well. With combined action from all mechanisms, permeability change varies by two orders of magnitude between injection and withdrawal.},

	abstract = {A model is developed to represent mechanical strain, stress-enhanced dissolution, and shear dilation as innately hysteretic and interlinked processes in rough contacting fractures. The model is incorporated into a numerical simulator designed to examine permeability change and thermal exchange in chemically active and deformable fractured reservoirs. A candidate engineered geothermal reservoir system (EGS) is targeted. The mechanistic model is able to distinguish differences between the evolution of ﬂuid transmission characteristics of (1) small scale, closely spaced fractures, and (2) largescale, more widely spaced fractures. Alternate realizations of fracture frequency and scale, exhibiting identical initial bulk permeability, lead to signiﬁcantly different conclusions regarding permeability evolution and thermal drawdown within the reservoir. Reactivation, primarily through mechanical shear, of pervasive, large-scale fractures is shown capable of causing both hydraulic and thermal short circuiting. Small variations in fracture scale impact the balance between the efﬁciency of thermal transfer and the rate of ﬂuid circulation. Stress-enhanced chemical dissolution, initially at equilibrium within the reservoir, may be reactivated as fractures are forced out of equilibrium during hydraulic fracturing. At the conditions examined (250 1C reservoir with 70 1C injection), however, shear dilation exerts dominant control over changes to permeability. Heterogeneity in permeability, generated from a normal distribution of fracture spacing, impacts thermal breakthrough times at the withdrawal well, as well as withdrawal rates. For the given conditions, spatial variability over \$ 1 order of magnitude leads to a reduction of \$ 10\% in withdrawal rates compared to a spatially uniform system. Permeability is a strongly dynamic property and at geothermal conditions is inﬂuenced by the full suite of THMC interactions.},

	abstract = {We utilize a continuum model of reservoir behavior subject to coupled THMC (thermal, hydraulic, mechanical and chemical) processes to explore the evolution of stimulation-induced seismicity and related permeability in EGS reservoirs. Our continuum model is capable of accommodating changes in effective stresses that result due to the evolving spatial variations in ﬂuid pressure as well as thermal stress and chemical effects. Discrete penny-shaped fractures (∼10–1200 m) are seeded within the reservoir volume at both prescribed (large faults) and random (small fractures) orientations and with a Gaussian distribution of lengths and location. Failure is calculated from a continuum model using a Coulomb criterion for friction. Energy release magnitude is utilized to obtain the magnitude-moment relation for induced seismicity by location and with time. This model is applied to a single injector (stimulation) to the proposed Newberry EGS ﬁeld (USA). Reservoir stimulation is assumed to be completed in four zones at depths of 2000, 2500, 2750 and 3000 m. The same network of large fractures (density of 0.003 m−1 and spacing 300 m) is applied in all zones and supplemented by more closely spaced fractures with densities from 0.26 m−1 (deepest zone) through 0.5 m−1 (shallow zone) to 0.9 m−1 (intermediate depth zone). We show that permeability enhancement is modulated by hydraulic, thermal, and chemical (THMC) processes and that permeability increases by an order of magnitude during stimulation at each depth. For the low density fracture networks, the increase in permeability reaches a smaller radius from the injection point and permeability evolution is slower with time compared to the behavior of the higher density fracture network. For seismic events that develop with the stimulation, event magnitude (Ms) varies from −2 to +1.9 and the largest event size (∼1.9) corresponds to the largest fractures (∼1200 m) within the reservoir. We illustrate that the model with the highest fracture density generates both the most and the largest seismic events (Ms = 1.9) within the 21 day stimulation. Rate of hydraulic and thermal transport has a considerable inﬂuence on the frequency, location and time of failure and ultimately event rate. Thus the event rate is highest when the fracture network has the largest density (0.9 m−1) and is located at depth where the initial stresses are also highest. Also apparent from these data is that the closely spaced fracture network with the higher stress regime (at the deeper level) has the largest b-value ∼0.74.},

	abstract = {Cemented paste backﬁll (CPB), a mixture of tailings, water and binder, is extensively used in underground mines worldwide for ground support and tailings disposal. The prediction of the behavior of CPB structures from early to advanced ages is of great practical importance. Once placed underground, the behavior of CPB is controlled by complex multiphysics (thermal, hydraulic, chemical and mechanical) processes. Modeling of the coupled THMC processes that occur in CPB are crucial for reliably assessing and predicting the performance of CPB structures. Yet there is currently no tool to predict the thermo–hydro-mechanical–chemical (THMC) behavior of CPB, or the performance of CPB under coupled THMC loadings. Therefore, a new multiphysics model is presented in this paper to describe and predict the coupled THMC behavior of CPB and its evolution with time. The governing equations of the model result from a combination of a set of conservation and constitutive equations. Four balance equations (water and air mass, momentum (mechanical equilibrium) and energy conservation equations) are taken into consideration. The model considers full coupling between the thermal, hydraulic, chemical (binder hydration) processes and CPB deformation as well as changes in CPB properties resultant of these phenomena, such as stress–strain relationship, thermal conductivity, permeability, porosity, and strength. The model coefﬁcients are identiﬁed in terms of measurable parameters. The prediction capability of the developed model is then tested against laboratory and ﬁeld tests conducted on CPB. Good agreement between the modeling results and experimental data conﬁrms the capability of the developed model to well capture the THMC behavior of CPB and its evolution.},

Due to the very high salinity of the brine contained in the fractured granite and the limited kinetic data for high temperature, a new code called FRACHEM has been developed to simulate the coupled thermal-hydraulic and chemical processes of ﬂow in the fractured system. The goal is to forecast the long term behaviour of the reservoir under exploitation. Among the minerals taken into account for this simulation (calcite, dolomite, quartz and pyrite), carbonate reactions predominate. Their reaction rates are higher than the quartz and pyrite reaction rates. The amount of quartz and pyrite precipitated is neglected. As a consequence of calcite dissolution, the porosity increases at the injection point with resulting permeability changes .},

For injection of undersaturated or oversaturated water with respect to the solubility of amorphous silica, the highest rates of reactive alteration occur at some distance away from the injection well. This is largely because the temperature dependence of the reaction rate plays a much greater role than temperature dependent solubility. For oversaturated injection, precipitation occurs in a band, conﬁning the ﬂow system to smaller areas. For undersaturated injection, dissolution causes permeability growth far from the injection well, resulting in longer ﬂowpaths that prevent short-circuits, which implies favorable conditions for sustained energy production. Initial permeability heterogeneity inﬂuences reservoir response signiﬁcantly only when the correlation lengths are of the order of 1/10th of the fracture size or more.},

Recently the eﬀects of heterogeneity on the temperature drawdown and transmissivity alteration due to dissolution/precipitation and thermo-elastic deformation of silicate reservoir were studied. The previous results based on numerical modeling have indicated that energy production rate is aﬀected by correlation length and standard deviation of initial heterogeneous aperture ﬁeld. The formation of a preferential ﬂow path or channel is one of the most important consequences of heterogeneity when aperture alteration due to thermo-chemical and thermo-mechanical eﬀects is signiﬁcant. Previous studies have shown signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the aperture alteration patterns of initially uniform fractures in carbonate and silicate reservoirs. Retrograde solubility and fast reaction rate of calcite with water are responsible for this. This has motivated us to study the eﬀect of heterogeneity in carbonate reservoir. We have shown that the heterogeneity has much stronger eﬀect in carbonate reservoir than that in silicate reservoir. In some cases the nature of evolution is completely diﬀerent from homogeneous case under same injection conditions.},

Debris materials are a typical granular material with viscous interstitial fluid and show solid-like behaviors before failure and fluid-like behaviors after failure. Based on Bagnold’s pioneering work on granular–fluid flows, we propose a framework for constitutive model development, which has an additive form. Based on this framework, a unified constitutive model for granular–fluid material in the quasi-static and dense flow regimes is developed. The main intergranular interactions and granular–fluid interactions controlling the mechanical behaviors are taken into account using the Mohr–Coulomb model and a Bagnold-type relation. Dry granular flows in three simple configurations, i.e., plain shear, vertical chute flow and flow on an inclined plane, are studied. Analytical solutions based on the presented unified model are obtained. Comparisons between results from the presented model and the \$\${\textbackslash}mu (I)\$\$model indicate that the explicit partition of frictional and collisional stress components provides insights into dense granular flows. In addition, the new model is used to predict the stress–strain relations in two annular shear tests. The applicability and advantages of the unified model are discussed.},

	abstract = {A two-phase numerical model using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is applied to two-phase liquid-sediments flows. The absence of a mesh in SPH is ideal for interfacial and highly non-linear flows with changing fragmentation of the interface, mixing and resuspension. The rheology of sediment induced under rapid flows undergoes several states which are only partially described by previous research in SPH. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between the geotechnics, non-Newtonian and Newtonian flows by proposing a model that combines the yielding, shear and suspension layer which are needed to predict accurately the global erosion phenomena, from a hydrodynamics prospective. The numerical SPH scheme is based on the explicit treatment of both phases using Newtonian and the non-Newtonian Bingham-type Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou constitutive model. This is supplemented by the Drucker-Prager yield criterion to predict the onset of yielding of the sediment surface and a concentration suspension model. The multi-phase model has been compared with experimental and 2-D reference numerical models for scour following a dry-bed dam break yielding satisfactory results and improvements over well-known SPH multi-phase models. With 3-D simulations requiring a large number of particles, the code is accelerated with a graphics processing unit (GPU) in the open-source DualSPHysics code. The implementation and optimisation of the code achieved a speed up of x58 over an optimised single thread serial code. A 3-D dam break over a non-cohesive erodible bed simulation with over 4 million particles yields close agreement with experimental scour and water surface profiles.},

	abstract = {Simulation of large deformation and post-failure of geomaterial in the framework of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) are presented in this study. The Drucker–Prager model with associated and non-associated plastic flow rules is implemented into the SPH code to describe elastic–plastic soil behavior. In contrast to previous work on SPH for solids, where the hydrostatic pressure is often estimated from density by an equation of state, this study proposes to calculate the hydrostatic pressure of soil directly from constitutive models. Results obtained in this paper show that the original SPH method, which has been successfully applied to a vast range of problems, is unable to directly solve elastic–plastic flows of soil because of the so-called SPH tensile instability. This numerical instability may result in unrealistic fracture and particles clustering in SPH simulation. For non-cohesive soil, the instability is not serious and can be completely removed by using a tension cracking treatment from soil constitutive model and thereby give realistic soil behavior. However, the serious tensile instability that is found in SPH application for cohesive soil requires a special treatment to overcome this problem. In this paper, an artificial stress method is applied to remove the SPH numerical instability in cohesive soil. A number of numerical tests are carried out to check the capability of SPH in the current application. Numerical results are then compared with experimental and finite element method solutions. The good agreement obtained from these comparisons suggests that SPH can be extended to general geotechnical problems. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a parallel computing Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework for geophysical granular flows scalable on large CPU clusters. The framework is accomplished by adopting a Message Passing Interface (MPI) approach with domain partitioning strategy. The Orthogonal Recursive Bisection (ORB) technique is utilised to subdivide the computational domain. The ORB algorithm is implemented such that any number of MPI processes can be used instead of being limited to powers of two. To avoid global communications in the particle distribution process, a diffusion-based distribution algorithm is implemented and demonstrated to be much faster than global communication approaches when distributing particles to non-neighbouring processes. The proposed parallel scheme achieves 95\% weak scaling efficiency and up to 900 times strong scaling speedup on 1024 CPU cores. The parallel scheme enables previously unfeasible simulations to be carried out and here we apply it to the investigation of the granular column collapse experiment under full three-dimensional, axisymmetric conditions for aspect ratios up to 30, not attempted previously using numerical techniques in the literature. Enabled by the parallel scheme, the simulations use up to 11.7 million SPH particles. The investigation is conducted using two popular constitutive models commonly used in modelling of granular flows: the elasto-plastic model with Drucker-Prager yield criterion and the μI rheological model. While very good agreement with experimental data has been reported for both models for small and intermediate aspect ratios, the large-scale simulations conducted for large aspect ratios show that the Drucker-Prager model tends to over-predict final deposit height, and the μI model under-predicts it. Furthermore, due to the capability of the parallel scheme to model the 3D axisymmetric column collapse at higher resolutions, we demonstrate that the elasto-plastic approach is capable of capturing arching effects in the stress profile, whereas the μI model cannot.},

	abstract = {The ubiquitous natural sedimentary reservoirs and their high permeability have made the CO2 plume geothermal system increasingly attractive. However, the complicated fluid-rock interactions during the geothermal exploitation can cause severe reservoir damage, constraining the excellent heat mining performance of the CO2 and decreasing the possible applications of the CO2 plume geothermal system. In order to analyze and solve this energy issue affecting the geothermal exploitation, in this study, a comprehensive numerical simulation model was established, which can consider formation water evaporation, salt precipitation, CO2-water-rock geochemical reactions, and the changes in reservoir porosity and permeability in the CO2 plume geothermal (CPG) system. Using this model, the geochemical reactions and salt precipitation and their effects on the geothermal exploitation were analyzed, and some measures were proposed to reduce the influence of fluid-rock interactions on the heat mining rate. The simulation results show that the gravity and the negative gas-liquid capillary pressure gradient induced by evaporation can cause the formation water to flow toward the injector. The back flow of the formation water results in salt precipitation accumulation in the injection well region, which can cause severe reservoir damage and consequent reductions to the heat mining rate. The CO2-water-rock geochemical reactions could result in the dissolution of certain minerals and precipitation of others, but its minimal influence on the heat mining rate can be ignored. However, salt precipitation can affect the geochemical reactions by influencing the CO2 flow and distribution, which can reduce the heat mining rate up to 2/5 of the original. Sensitivity studies show that the reservoir condition can affect the salt precipitation and heat mining rate, so a sedimentary reservoir with high temperature, high porosity and permeability, and low salinity should be selected for CPG application, with an appropriately high injection-production pressure difference. The injection of low salinity water before CO2 injection and the combined injection of CO2 and water vapor can be applied to reduce the salt precipitation and increase the heat mining rate in the CPG system.},

A model predictive control strategy is designed, which uses volume measurements in the storage tank, and predictions of the demand, to regulate the production of the geothermal system in real time. The implications of such time-varying production for the reservoir are investigated using a 2D reactive transport reservoir model. As a case study, the Groningen geothermal project is considered. The numerical data generated by the controller, in closed loop with a modelled district-heating network, are used as inputs for the reservoir simulations. The latter make use of discrete parameter analyses to evaluate the effect of pressure depletion, reservoir permeability, flow rate, re-injection temperature and injection pH on the geothermal reservoir, and also mitigate possible risks during development. Using a model predictive control does not create adverse geochemical effects in the reservoir; instead, the controller is able to improve the efficiency of the geothermal heat extraction. The findings pave the way for stronger integration between elements of heat networks and a more sustainable development of geothermal resources.},

	abstract = {The incompressible \${\textbackslash}mu(I)\$-rheology has been used to study subaerial granular flows with remarkable success. For subaquatic granular flows, drag between grains and the pore fluid is substantially higher and the physical behaviour is more complex. High drag forces constrain the rearrangement of grains and dilatancy, leading to a considerable build-up of pore pressure. Its transient and dynamic description is the key to modelling subaquatic granular flows but out of the scope of incompressible models. In this work, we advance from the incompressible \${\textbackslash}mu(I)\$-rheology to the compressible \${\textbackslash}mu(J)\$-\${\textbackslash}phi(J)\$-rheology to account for pore pressure, dilatancy, and the scaling laws under subaquatic conditions. The model is supplemented with critical state theory to yield the correct properties in the quasi-static limit. The pore fluid is described by an additional set of conservation equations and the interaction with grains is described by a drag model. This new implementation enables us to include most of the physical processes relevant for submerged granular flows in a highly transparent manner. Both, the incompressible and compressible rheologies are implemented into OpenFOAM and various simulations at low and high Stokes numbers are conducted with both frameworks. We found a good agreement of the \${\textbackslash}mu(J)\$-\${\textbackslash}phi(J)\$-rheology with low Stokes number experiments, that incompressible models fail to describe. The combination of granular rheology, pore pressure, and drag model leads to complex phenomena such as apparent cohesion, remoulding, hydroplaning, and turbidity currents. The simulations give remarkable insights into these phenomena and increase our understanding of subaquatic mass transports.},

	abstract = {High-temperature aquifer thermal energy storage (HT-ATES) involves seasonal storage of residual heat and is an important instrument in building an energy efficient future. HT-ATES could prove to be a better alternative than the lower enthalpy aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES), because it can be directly applied to a district heating network without using heat pumps. There is however a knowledge gap of the potential of HT-ATES in the Netherlands. This study aims to give a first-order approximation of the spatial distribution of this potential in specific aquifers, using a Java workflow. Using recently developed subsurface models of the Netherlands, it was possible to make probability maps of the economic potential of HT-ATES. A previous study by Pluymaekers et al. (2013) indicated certain shallow reservoirs within the North Sea super group to be of interest for HT-ATES. This study therefore assesses the potential in these aquifers, together with certain deeper aquifers.
By assuming a log-normal distribution and by generating a transmissivity distribution through Monte Carlo sampling, transmissivity maps with P10, P30, P50, P70 and P90 confidence levels are generated. To identify key parameters that influence the recovery efficiency and to find a computationally fast method for the approximation of these efficiencies, two faster analytical methods are compared with the numerical model DoubletCalc3D. The results indicated that the Rayleigh-based method (Schout et al., 2014) is the most accurate and computationally fast method, whereas the Radial Dupuit Interface Flow method (Bakker, 2009) delivered inadequate results.
The Rayleigh-based method is then implemented into the Java workflow to calculate the Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the HT-ATES system. The Excel workflow that was developed by Pluymaekers et al. (2013) is used to calculate the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE), where a LCOE \&lt;6 EUR/GJ marks an economic potential for HT-ATES, and higher values have less potential. The results indicated that the deeper aquifers (Delft Sandstone member, Rijnland group and Lower/Middle North Sea groups) have no potential, with some local exceptions, due to the low transmissivities and depth of the aquifers. The shallower reservoirs (Breda, Oosterhout and Maassluis formations) showed a high potential for HT-ATES, confirming the assessment done by Pluymeakers et al. (2013).},

Due to the large temperature differences between the injection fluid and ambient groundwater, buoyancy flow occurs, which causes heat losses which in turn results in poor efficiency of such systems. The heat losses can be reduced by applying density difference compensation, this entails injection water with a higher salinity, to compensate for the low density caused by the high temperature of the injection fluid.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;The goal of this study is to get insight into the behaviour of a possible HT-ATES system on the campus of the TU Delft with the injection of saline groundwater from deeper layers for storage in both less deep and less saline aquifers. To achieve this different cases will be considered; a reference case, a theoretical optimum, density difference compensation of the TU Delft case and the optimum density difference compensation. For these cases, different scenarios are modelled in SEAWAT to identify the influence of injection temperature, injection volume, aquifer thickness, and hydraulic conductivity on the behaviour of the system. \&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Using the density difference compensation from the aquifer at TU Delft, with a salinity of 16.4 kg/m\${\textasciicircum}3\$, a maximum improvement of 2.0{\textbackslash}\% can be achieved. Also, differences between the different scenarios for the TU Delft case were maximum 2.5{\textbackslash}\%, with exception for a thicker aquifer or smaller injection volume. Due to the large injection volume in thin aquifers, the hot water has a large volume, causing conduction losses to dominate in the system. For thick aquifers a lot of density driven flow occurs in the reference case. With optimum density difference compensation, having a salinity of 39.1 kg/m\${\textasciicircum}3\$, the density driven flow can be significantly decreased and the efficiency increased with 21.5{\textbackslash}\%. Both aquifer thickness and salinity of the injection fluid have a negative correlation with salt recovery. \&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Thin aquifers in relation to injection volume are not sensitive to density driven flow, so density difference compensation is not useful for such HT-ATES systems. Density difference compensation in the case of the TU does give significant improvement in efficiency. The most influential parameter on the efficiency is aquifer thickness, for both the cold and warm well, in relation to injection volume. For thick aquifers with optimum density difference compensation the highest efficiency of 75.5{\textbackslash}\% is achieved after 10 cycles.},

The solution method is based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and the soil is modeled using a simplified hypoplastic material law. In order to correctly compute the forces on the soil due to the contact between the pile and the soil, a formulation for imposing frictional boundary conditions using SPH is developed. Modeling the soil with the chosen hypoplastic approach also allows for tensile forces in the soil. However, these are not physical. Therefore, an alternative formulation is presented which directly eliminates unphysical tensile stresses in the cohesionless soil without any additional numerical parameters. The numerical code is firstly validated against benchmark problems. Then several test cases are simulated including monotonic and cyclic penetration of piles into the soil. A good agreement with the experimental observation is found. Additionally, the impact of pile driving in the presence of sheetpiles (retainers) is investigated to see how the pile driving can alter the applied forces on the sheet piles. The simulation of such complex geotechnical problems that involve large deformation, material nonlinearity, and moving boundary conditions demonstrates the applicability and versatility of the proposed numerical tool in this field.},

A friction law for non-steady flows, incorporating rate-dependence and dilation, is derived and implemented within the constitutive law. We compare our SPH simulations with experimental data, demonstrating that they can capture both steady and non-steady dynamic flow behavior, notably including transient column collapse profiles. This technique may therefore be attractive for modeling the time-dependent evolution of natural and industrial flows.},

It is suitable to solve problems involving large deformation, free-surface, cracking and fragmentation. To promote the research and application of SPH in geotechnical engineering, we present LOQUAT, an open-source three-dimensional GPU accelerated SPH solver. LOQUAT employs the standard SPH formulations for solids with two geomechnical constitutive models which are the Drucker–Prager model and a hypoplastic model. Three stabilization techniques, namely, artificial viscosity, artificial pressure and stress regularization are included. A generalized boundary particle method is presented to model static and moving boundaries with arbitrary geometry. LOQUAT employs GPU acceleration technique to greatly increase the computational efficiency. Numerical examples show that the solver is convergent, stable and highly efficient. With a mainstream GPU, it can simulate large scale problems with tens of millions of particles, and easily performs more than one thousand times faster than serial CPU code.},

	abstract = {A coupled total Lagrangian (TL) and weakly compressible (WC) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is presented to model three-dimensional fluid–structure interactions (FSI) with deformable structures. In the coupled TL–WC SPH, the fluid phase is simulated using WCSPH, while the structure solver is based on TLSPH. The three main deficiencies of solid simulation using conventional SPH, i.e. inconsistency, tensile instability and hourglass mode are circumvented in the stabilized TLSPH by means of corrected kernel gradient, Lagrangian kernel function and hourglass control technique, respectively. The resulted stabilized TLSPH is stable, accurate and has almost quadratic convergence rate in solid modeling. To increase the accuracy in FSI modeling, the δ−SPH technique is employed to improve the pressure results in the fluid phase. Based on the Adami boundary condition (Adami et al., 2012), a unified framework for modeling solid boundaries and the fluid–structure interfaces is presented. Furthermore, the GPU parallelization is employed to accelerate the proposed TL–WC SPH method for higher efficiency. The coupled method is employed to simulate problems of pure fluid flow, elastic solids with large deformation and fluid–structure interaction with deformable structures. The numerical results are compared with analytical solutions and results from literature. The GPU efficiency and speed-up compared with CPU implementations are analyzed. The novelty of this work consists: (1) three-dimensional SPH modeling of FSI problems with deformable structures, (2) stabilized structure simulation free of hourglass mode, (3) a unified framework for FSI problems taking advantages of δ-SPH, TLSPH, hourglass control, and GPU acceleration. Importantly, with the hourglass control technique proposed by Ganzenmüller (2015), stresses can be captured accurately in the TL–WC SPH-based FSI simulations.},

	abstract = {Simulation of frictional contact between soils and rigid or deformable structure in the framework of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is presented in this study. Two algorithms are implemented into the SPH code to describe contact behavior, where the contact forces are calculated using the law of conservation of momentum based on ideal plastic collision or using the criteria of partial penetrating. In both algorithms, the problem of boundary deficiency inherited from SPH is properly handled so that the particles located at contact boundary can have precise acceleration, which is critical for contact detection. And the movement and rotation of the rigid structure are taken into account so that it is easy to simulate the process of pile driving or movement of a retaining wall in geotechnical engineering analysis. Furthermore, the capability of modeling deformability of a structure during frictional contact simulations broadens the fields of SPH application. In contrast to previous work dealing with contact in SPH, which usually use particle-to-particle contact or ignoring sliding between particles and solid structure, the method proposed here is more efficient and accurate, and it is suitable to simulate interaction between soft materials and rigid or deformable structures, which are very common in geotechnical engineering. A number of numerical tests are carried out to verify the accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithms, and their results are compared with analytical solutions or results from finite element method analysis. Good agreement obtained from these comparisons suggests that the proposed algorithms are robust and can be applied to extend the capability of SPH in solving geotechnical problems.

A validation shows that we recover hydrostatic equilibrium conditions in a static tank, and a comparison of the classical dam break simulation with state-of-the-art results in literature shows good agreement.

Utilizing the proposed boundary algorithms, the accuracy of different methods to calculate the interaction force between SPH particles and a boundary surface is investigated. The effect of SPH artificial viscosity on the oscillation and accuracy of the calculated interaction force is also examined. It is found that using high artificial viscosities may unphysically damp out energy of the system and the use of dynamic artificial viscosity, which varies with time and space, may remediate this problem. Employing the proposed frictional boundary algorithms, the effect of basal friction on the collapse of granular columns is investigated. It is shown that the flow of a collapsing granular column can be divided into three flow regimes: a conical-shaped stationary regime, a collapsing regime, and a spreading regime. It is found that the existence and the interaction of these regimes are affected by basal friction. Additionally, the effect of basal friction on the final runout distance and deposit height is investigated.},

	abstract = {Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are engineered reservoirs developed to extract heat from low permeability and low porosity geological formations. Cyclic hydraulic stimulation treatments can be used in some cases to create hydraulic fractures and gain access to the target formation fluids, drain the geothermal fluid and increase the overall productivity of the reservoir. During these operations, successive cycles of injection at high flow rates are conducted to decrease the effective minimum principal stress to the tensile strength of the material, developing a mode I fracture. Opening of the newly developed fractures induces additional deformation of the reservoir rocks whose impact on the far field reservoir hydraulics has not been addressed so far for real case applications. These rates of compressive deformation can be significantly high in the context of cyclic stimulation treatments and can lead to a poroelastic pore pressure increase which spans quasi-instantaneously at greater distances than diffusive processes. In this study, such a poroelastic response resulting from cyclic deformation during hydraulic stimulation treatment of a well is investigated using hydromechanical coupling between pore pressure variations and rock deformation. The effects of this poroelastic response on the hydromechanical state of a reservoir is illustrated with field measurements of a cyclic hydraulic stimulation treatment conducted at the Groß Schönebeck geothermal research site in August 2007. This study demonstrates that the pore pressure increase monitored in a neighbor well located approximately 475 m away from the stimulated well at reservoir depth is controlled by diffusive processes responsible for the long-term increase of pore pressure, but also by poroelastic effects responsible for the quasi-instantaneous local peaks in pore pressure. The results from this applied study helped to quantify the relevance of the poroelastic behavior of stimulated reservoir rocks in a way than can improve current understanding of such hydraulic stimulation settings.},

For this purpose, the alteration of the in-situ stress state and the related change of slip tendency for existing fault zones due to stimulation treatments and reservoir operations is numerical simulated. Changes in slip tendency can potentially lead to reactivation of fault zones, the related movement can lead to the occurrence of seismic events. In the current numerical study, results obtained based on the thermal–hydraulic–mechanical coupled simulation are compared to field observations. In particular, the study focuses on describing the fault reactivation potential: (1) under in-situ stress conditions; (2) during a waterfrac stimulation treatment; and (3) during a projected 30 years production and injection period at the in-situ geothermal test-site Groß Schönebeck. The in-situ stress state indicates no potential for fault reactivation. During a waterfrac stimulation treatment, micro-seismic events were recorded. Our current evaluation shows an increase of slip tendency during the treatment above the failure level in the direct vicinity of the micro-seismic events. During the projected production and injection period, despite increased thermal stress, the values for slip tendency are below the threshold for fault reactivation. Based on these results, and to prove the applied method to evaluate the observed micro-seismic events, a final discussion is opened. This includes the in-situ stress state, the role of pre-existing fault zones, the adopted criterion for fault reactivation, and a 3D rock failure criterion based on true triaxial measurements.},

It may be considered as an extension of the Critical State concept. It is based on recently published hypoplastic equations and covers a wide range of densities, pressures and deformations. A factorial decomposition allows a rather easy separation and determination of material parameters. Two factors depend on a relative void ratio so that it remains within lower and upper bounds. The bounding void ratios decrease monotonously from maximal values to zero with increasing pressure. The same reduction of the void ratio is proposed for an isotropic compression starting from a suspension. Thus a granulate hardness is defined, and a stiffness factor can be determined. Four material parameters can be estimated from classification tests and determined from the asymptotic behaviour in element tests. Four further parameters are determined by calibration; they are rather constant for wide groups of materials. Strength and stiffness values can be derived and used for the analysis of deformations, stability, and flow. The viscous behaviour is modelled by a rate dependent factor with one further parameter. Limitations and possible extensions of this comprehensive approach are also outlined.},

	abstract = {Geosystems are geological formations altered by humans activities such as fossil energy exploration, waste disposal, geologic carbon sequestration, and renewable energy generation. Geosystems also represent a critical link in the global water-energy nexus, providing both the source and buffering mechanisms for enabling societal adaptation to climate variability and change. The responsible use and exploration of geosystems are thus critical to the geosystem governance, which in turn depends on the efficient monitoring, risk assessment, and decision support tools for practical implementation. Fast advances in machine learning (ML) algorithms and novel sensing technologies in recent years have presented new opportunities for the subsurface research community to improve the efficacy and transparency of geosystem governance. Although recent studies have shown the great promise of scientific ML (SciML) models, questions remain on how to best leverage ML in the management of geosystems, which are typified by multiscality, high-dimensionality, and data resolution inhomogeneity. This survey will provide a systematic review of the recent development and applications of domain-aware SciML in geosystem researches, with an emphasis on how the accuracy, interpretability, scalability, defensibility, and generalization skill of ML approaches can be improved to better serve the geoscientific community.},

	abstract = {Successful geologic CO2 storage projects depend on numerical simulations to predict reservoir performance during site selection, injection verification, and post-injection monitoring phases of the project. These numerical simulations solve non-linear sets of coupled partial differential equations, while accounting for multi-phase fluid dynamics on the basis of constitutive equations that are embedded into the solution scheme. As a consequence, individual simulations often require tens to hundreds of hours to complete on high-performance computing clusters. Moreover, laboratory experiments reveal that parametric functions for capillary pressure and relative permeability exhibit substantial variability, even within the same rock type. This combination of computational expense and wide-ranging parametric variability means that there remains substantial uncertainty in the behavior of multi-phase CO2-water systems, particularly in the context of feedbacks between relative perme­ ability and capillary pressure. To bridge this knowledge gap, we develop a novel workflow that utilizes physicsbased numerical simulation to train an artificial neural network (ANN) emulator for interrogating the multi­ variate parameter space that governs both capillary pressure and relative permeability. With this approach, the ANN is trained to emulate both fluid pressure distribution and CO2 saturation, which are then interrogated quantitatively to generate parametric response surface mappings with high-fidelity resolution. Results from this study initially show that capillary entry pressure is the dominant control on both CO2 plume geometry and fluid pressure propagation when considering the combined effects of capillary pressure and relative permeability, particularly when phase interference is low and residual CO2 saturation is high. Moreover, the ANN emulator provides tremendous computational speed-up by computing 2691 individual simulations in several minutes; whereas, the same simulation ensemble would have required {\textasciitilde}3 years of simulation time using only physicsbased simulation methods (25,000 times speed up).},

In this work, we infer CO2 saturation levels at three depths from simulated surface seismic, downhole pressure and total dissolved solids (TDS) data using machine learning (ML) methods. The simulated monitoring data are based on 6000 numerical multi-phase flow simulations of hypothetical wellbore CO2 and brine leakage from a legacy well into shallow aquifers at a model CO2 storage site. We conduct rock physics modeling to estimate changes in seismic velocity due to the simulated CO2 and brine leakage at each time step in the flow simulation outputs, resulting in 120,000 forward seismic velocity models. 2D finite-difference acoustic wave modeling is performed for each velocity model to generate synthetic shot gathers, along a sparse 2D seismic line with only 5 shots and 40 receivers. We extract 6 time-lapse seismic attribute anomalies from each trace in the time window relevant to each geologic layer, and use the seismic features, together with downhole pore pressure, TDS features to train the machine learning algorithms. The impact of seismic noise on the performance of the trained machine learning models has also been investigated. Inferred CO2 saturations from the trained classifiers are in good agreement with observations. Direct pressure and TDS measurements from downhole monitoring can increase the accuracy of the inferred CO2 saturation class from the forward modeled 2D surface seismic data. Our ML workflow represents a promising way to combine measurements from multiple monitoring techniques, together with seismic monitoring to achieve more accurate seismic quantitative interpretation.},

We develop a coupled formulation for including the effects of gas competitive adsorption, decompression, Knudsen diffusion, slippage, advection, and Fickian diffusion for multicomponent single-phase CO2-CH4 systems. Several stochastic micro-structures of fractured shale samples are generated and processed for pore network extraction. Extracted pore networks contain microporosities as well as mesopores and fractures. Next, we show that the dynamic numerical approach can be substituted with steady state model which is only 2.3\% less accurate but 3 to 4 orders of magnitude computationally faster to execute. In order to enhance the computational limits even further, we train a deep learning model on 3982 simulated steady state cases with r-squared greater than 0.93. In addition, we define a storage quality criterion for recognizing suitable shale samples for CO2 sequestration which depends both on the rate and amount of adsorption. Using this criterion and the developed ML tool, a large number of shale pore-scale images can be ranked based on their suitability in an efficient and accurate manner. The proposed workflow is useful for se­ lection of the proper geological locations for subsurface CO2 storage by analysing the available image datasets.},

In future, billions of watts of electrical power will be generated from geothermal energy sources. Subsurface earth can store the energy produced from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, and could provide safe storage of contaminants and hazardous nuclear waste. Engineering of subsurface earth is critical for fossil energy production, geothermal energy production, and carbon geo-sequestration. However, the subsurface is opaque, inaccessible, and heterogenous with nano-scale to kilo-scale processes that limits our understanding (characterization) and constrains the efficient engineering of the complex subsurface earth resources. There has been rapid increase in sensor deployment, data acquisition, data storage, and data processing for purposes of better engineering and characterizing the subsurface earth. This has promoted large-scale deployment of datadriven methods, machine learning, and data analytics workflows. Subsurface data ranges from nano-scale to kilometer-scale passive as well as active measurements. Subsurface data is acquired in the form of physical fluid/solid samples, images, 3D scans, time-series data, waveforms, and depth-based multi-modal signals, to name a few. Subsurface data sense various physical phenomena, e.g., transport, chemical, mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Integration of such varied data sources being acquired at varying scales, rates, resolutions, and volumes mandates robust machine learning methods to better characterize and engineer the subsurface earth. Machine learning has shown to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and productivity of subsurface engineering and characterization efforts required to produce fossil/geothermal energy and to sequester carbon dioxide.},

	abstract = {We outline a continuum approach for treating discrete granular flows that holds across multiple scales: from experiments that focus on centimeter-size control volumes, to tests that involve landslides and large buildings. The time evolution of the continuum used to capture the granular dynamics is resolved in space via the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The interaction between the granular material and immersed rigid bodies is posed and solved as a “fluid”–solid interaction (FSI) problem using boundary conditions enforcing (BCE) SPH particles rigidly attached onto the boundary of the body interacting with the granular material. A new penetration-based particle shifting technique (PPST) is proposed to enforce the particle regularity and thus a stable simulation. Several numerical experiments (angle of repose, ball drop, and cone penetration) are carried out to validate the accuracy of the proposed methodology. The approach is subsequently demonstrated in conjunction with a 3D landslide simulation and a plowing operation. The approach discussed has been implemented and can be used in an open source simulation platform publicly available on GitHub. The implementation leverages GPU computing.},

It is important to understand how granular material flows around such obstacles in order to enhance the design of defense structures. In this study, a three dimensional (3-D) Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model is developed to simulate granular flow past different types of obstacles. The elastic–perfectly plastic model with implementation of the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion is applied to simulate the material behavior, which describes the stress states of soil in the plastic flow regime. The model was validated by simulating the collapse of a 3-D column of sand with two different aspect ratios; the results showed that the SPH method is capable of simulating granular flow. The model is then applied to simulate the gravity-driven granular flow down an inclined surface obstructed by a group of columns with different spacing, a circular cylinder and a tetrahedral wedge. The numerical results are then compared with experimental results and two different numerical solutions. The good agreements obtained from these comparisons demonstrate that the SPH method may be a powerful method for simulating granular flow and can be extended to design protective structures.},

The stabilized TLSPH with corrected kernel gradient, Lagrangian kernel function and hourglass control technique overcomes the common deficiencies of inconsistency, tensile instability and hourglass mode in structure modeling. Based on the Adami boundary condition (Adami et al., 2012), a unified framework for modeling solid boundaries and the granular mediastructure interfaces is presented. Furthermore, the advanced GPU-acceleration is employed to achieve high efficiency. The coupled method is employed to simulate problems of granular collapse, granular material-structure interaction at quasi-static regime and granular flows impact on rigid and deformable structures. The presented method can simulate granular flows, the flow-structure interactions, and the deformation and stress of the structures correctly.

	abstract = {Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) uses excess thermal energy to heat water which is stored in an aquifer until it is needed, at which time the hot water is recovered and the heat used for some purpose e.g. electricity generation. The recovery efficiency (i.e. the ratio of heat energy recovered to heat energy injected, R) is one of the most important factors dictating the viability of ATES systems. The variation of R with various aquifer properties and operating parameters is explored for high temperature (HT) ATES systems with injection temperatures ≥90∘C, extending the results of previous studies to higher temperatures and a broader range of aquifer properties and operating conditions. R values are calculated using numerical models of a single-well ATES system, which is validated by comparison with previous field and modelling studies. The results show that HT-ATES may be viable with injection temperatures as high as 300 ∘C, depending on the aquifer properties and operating parameters. Daily cycles are very efficient over a broad range of conditions, whereas the efficiency of annual cycles is much more variable. The most important parameters governing R are aquifer thickness, injection temperature, horizontal and vertical permeability, and dispersion length. The R values are used to derive an improved version of the Rayleigh number relationship proposed by Schout et al. (2014), extending the applicability of this relationship to daily cycles and improving its accuracy for annual cycles. An alternative method for estimating R using a convolutional neural network is proposed. The calculated R values may be considered best-case because aspects such as background groundwater flow and geochemical effects are ignored. Practical factors such as energy supply/demand requirements, reservoir and above-ground engineering, financial or regulatory aspects, and public acceptance are not considered. Nevertheless, the results of this study can be used for rapid screening of large areas for potential HT-ATES sites, defining requirements for potential sites, and estimating R values for specific sites, before performing detailed feasibility studies.},

	abstract = {To aid in testing the idea of storing thermal energy in aquifers, an experiment was performed by Auburn University in which 54,784 m3 of water was pumped from a shallow supply aquifer, heated to an average temperature of 55°C, and injected into a deeper confined aquifer where the ambient temperature was 20°C. After a storage period of 51 days, 55,345 m3 of water were produced from the confined aquifer. Throughout the experiment, which lasted approximately 6 months, groundwater temperatures were recorded at six depths in each of 10 observation wells, and hydraulic heads were recorded in five observation wells. In order to prevent errors due to thermal convection, most of the observation wells recording temperature had to be backfilled with sand. During the 41-day production period, the temperature of the produced water varied from 55° to 33°C, and 65\% of the injected thermal energy was recovered. At no time was an appreciable amount of free thermal convection observed in the storage formation. The dominant heat dissipation mechanisms appeared to be hydrodynamic thermal dispersion and possible mixing of cold and hot water induced by clogging and unclogging of the injection-production well. On the basis of laboratory and field studies, it was concluded that clogging of the injection well, which constituted the major technical problem during the experiment, was caused by the freshwater-sensitive nature of the storage aquifer. Due to the relatively low concentration of cations in the supply water, clay particles would swell, disperse, and migrate until they became trapped in the relatively small pores connecting the larger pores. Surging the pump and back washing the injection well would dislodge the clogging particles and temporarily improve the storage formation permeability. The phenomenon seems largely independent of temperature because it was reproduced in the laboratory with unheated water. It may, however, depend on pore velocity. Future research should be directed toward procedures for selecting storage aquifers that will have minimal susceptibility to clogging and other geochemical problems. Procedures for overcoming such difficulties are needed also because clogging and related phenomena will be more the rule than the exception. Designing an aquifer thermal storage system for maximum energy recovery would involve selecting an appropriate aquifer, analyzing the effects of hydrodynamic thermal dispersion and thermal convection if it is predicted to occur, anticipating geochemical problems, designing the optimum supply-injection-production well configuration and injecting a sufficiently large volume of heated water to realize economies of scale related to increasing volume-surface area ratio.},

	abstract = {Electrical power plant and solar heating systems have been proposed wherein confined ground-water aquifers are used as temporary storage reservoirs for thermal energy in the form of moderate to high temperature water (140°F-400°F; 60°C-204°C). The Water Resources Research Institute of Auburn University has performed an aquifer storage experiment involving warm water (97°F; 36°C). The objectives of the experimental program were to begin actual testing of the concept of heat storage in aquifers and to provide data for calibration of mathematical models describing the simultaneous transport of water and heat. Phase I consisted of drilling an exploratory well at the selected field site near Mobile, Alabama. Phase II involved construction of the central injection well, three observation wells, and performance of preliminary pumping tests. Phase III was devoted to construction of the remainder of the observation well field, performance of final pumping tests, and measurement of aquifer thermal properties; while Phase IV was devoted to a cycle of warm-water injection, storage, and recovery. It was concluded that heat storage aquifers must have low natural pore velocities, and care must be taken not to clog the injection well with solids or precipitated chemicals. Swelling of clays in the storage formation must be minimized, and hydraulic pressures capable of breaching the confining layers must be avoided. Mechanical and chemical clogging problems may be minimized by using formation water as influent to the heating system. For a 36-day storage of 2 million gallons, the calculated energy recovery factor of 0.69 was considered promising. Future research should be directed toward experimental studies involving larger volumes of water and high-injection temperatures. Study should be directed also to the geochemistry problem and the effect of high temperatures on the mechanical and hydraulic properties of clay confining layers.},

Unless this lowering occurs instantaneously it represents a loss of storage, either by the un-watering of a portion of the previously saturated sediments if the aquifer is nonartesian or by release of stored water by the compaction of the aquifer due to the lowered pressure if the aquifer is artesian. The mathematical theory of ground-water hydraulics has been based, apparently entirely, on a postulate that equilibrium has been attained and therefore that water-levels are no longer falling. In a great number of hydrologic problems, involving a well or pumping district near or in which water-levels are falling, the current theory is therefore not strictly applicable. This paper investigates in part the nature and consequences of a mathematical theory that considers the motion of ground-water before equilibrium is reached and, as a consequence, involves time as a variable.},

	abstract = {Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a key climate mitigation technology. Leakage of the injected CO2 is one of the major environmental concerns. The potential for CO2 leakage from wells is one of the critical risks identified in geological CO2 sequestration. The objective of this study is to develop a computerized statistical model with the neural network algorithm for predicting the probability of long-term leak of wells in CO2 sequestration operations. Well design and operation data for over 500 CO2 exposed wells were generated from the West Hastings oil field and Oyster Bayou oil field in southern Texas, USA. The well integrity conditions were assessed by analyzing the well attribute data (well type, well age, CO2 exposed period, well construction details and materials), well operation histories and regulatory changes. Leakage-safe Probability Index (LPI) was assigned to individual wells. A computerized statistical model with network algorithm was developed based on data processing and grouping. Comprehensive training and testing of the model were carried out to ensure that the model was accurate and efficient enough for predicting the probability of long-leak of wells in CO2 sequestration operations. The accuracy of the trained neural network for well leakage prediction was also verified by the field operation in the Cranfield Field, Mississippi, USA. The developed neural network model can improve the efficiency of the storage operations by predicting the risk of CO2 leakage in the current exposed wells. In addition, it can also contribute in developing best practices standards by proposing recommendations for well construction in future wells.},

	abstract = {Structural and topological information play a key role in modeling flow and transport through fractured rock in the subsurface. Discrete fracture network (DFN) computational suites such as dfnWorks (Hyman et al. Comput. Geosci. 84, 10–19 2015) are designed to simulate flow and transport in such porous media. Flow and transport calculations reveal that a small backbone of fractures exists, where most flow and transport occurs. Restricting the flowing fracture network to this backbone provides a significant reduction in the network’s effective size. However, the particle-tracking simulations needed to determine this reduction are computationally intensive. Such methods may be impractical for large systems or for robust uncertainty quantification of fracture networks, where thousands of forward simulations are needed to bound system behavior. In this paper, we develop an alternative network reduction approach to characterizing transport in DFNs, by combining graph theoretical and machine learning methods. We consider a graph representation where nodes signify fractures and edges denote their intersections. Using random forest and support vector machines, we rapidly identify a subnetwork that captures the flow patterns of the full DFN, based primarily on node centrality features in the graph. Our supervised learning techniques train on particle-tracking backbone paths found by dfnWorks, but run in negligible time compared to those simulations. We find that our predictions can reduce the network to approximately 20\% of its original size, while still generating breakthrough curves consistent with those of the original network.},

	abstract = {Discrete fracture networks (DFN) are often used to model flow and transport in fractured porous media. The accurate resolution of flow and transport behavior on a large DFN involving thousands of fractures is computationally expensive. This makes uncertainty quantification studies of quantities of interest such as travel time through the network computationally intractable, since hundreds to thousands of runs of the DFN model are required to get bounds on the uncertainty of the predictions. Prior works on the subject demonstrated that the complexity of a DFN could be reduced by considering a sub-network of it (often termed a “backbone” sub-network), one whose flow and transport properties were then shown to be similar to that of the full network. The technique is tantamount to partitioning the complete set of fractures of a network into two disjoint sets, one of which is the backbone sub-network while the other its complement. It is in this context that we present a system-reduction technique for DFNs using supervised machine learning via a Random Forest Classifier that selects a backbone sub-network from the full set of fractures. The in-sample errors (in terms of precision and recall scores) of the trained classifier are found to be very accurate indicators of the out-of-sample errors, thus exhibiting that the classifier generalizes well to test data. Moreover, this system-reduction technique yields sub-networks as small as 12\% of the full DFN that still recover transport characteristics of the full network such as the peak dosage and tailing behavior for late times. Most importantly, the sub-networks remain connected, and their size can be controlled by a single dimensionless parameter. Furthermore, measures of KL-divergence and KS-statistic for the breakthrough curves of the sub-networks with respect to the full network show physically realistic trends in that the measures decrease monotonically as the size of the sub-networks increase. The computational efficiency gained by this technique depends on the size of the sub-network, but large reductions in computational time can be expected for small sub-networks, yielding as much as 90\% computational savings for sub-networks that are as small as 10-12\% of the full network.},

In this paper, we demonstrate how a deep neural network (NN) trained on quantum mechanical (QM) DFT calculations can learn an accurate and transferable potential for organic molecules. We introduce ANAKIN-ME (Accurate NeurAl networK engINe for Molecular Energies) or ANI for short. ANI is a new method designed with the intent of developing transferable neural network potentials that utilize a highly-modified version of the Behler and Parrinello symmetry functions to build single-atom atomic environment vectors (AEV) as a molecular representation. AEVs provide the ability to train neural networks to data that spans both configurational and conformational space, a feat not previously accomplished on this scale. We utilized ANI to build a potential called ANI-1, which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8 heavy atoms in order to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four atom types: H, C, N, and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential surfaces, we also proposed a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for generating molecular conformations. Through a series of case studies, we show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to reference DFT calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms) than those included in the training data set.},

The traditional methods to study effective thermal conductivities of composite materials, such as the effective medium theory, the direct solution of heat diffusion equation, or the Boltzmann transport equation, are all based on developing good physical understanding of heat transfer mechanisms in those composite materials. In this work, we take a completely different approach to predict the effective thermal conductivities of composite materials using machine learning methods. With a set of trustable data, the support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and convolution neural network (CNN) are employed to train models that can predict the effective thermal conductivities of composite materials. We find that the models obtained from SVR, GPR, and CNN all have a better performance than the Maxwell-Eucken model and the Bruggeman model in terms of predicting accuracy. Our work demonstrates that machine learning methods are useful tools to fast predict the effective thermal conductivities of composite materials and porous media if the training data set is available. The machine learning approach also has the potential to be generalized and applied to study other physical properties of composite materials.},

	abstract = {Large-scale energy storage such as porous media hydrogen storage will be required to mitigate shortages originating from fluctuating power production if renewables dominate the total supply. In order to assess the applicability of this storage option, a possible usage scenario is defined for an existing anticlinal structure in the North German Basin and the storage operation is numerically simulated. A heterogeneous and realistic parameter distribution is generated by a facies modelling approach. The storage operation, which is performed using five wells, consists of an initial filling of the storage with nitrogen used as cushion gas and hydrogen as well as several week-long withdrawal periods each followed by a refill and a shut-in period. Storage performance increases with the number of storage cycles and a total of 29 million m3 of hydrogen gas at surface conditions can be produced in the long term, equating to 186,000 GJ of energy when assuming a re-electrification efficiency of 60 \%. In addition to downhole pressure monitoring geophysical techniques such as seismic full waveform inversion (FWI), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and gravity methods can be used for site monitoring, if their individual detecting capabilities are sufficient. Investigation of the storage scenario by virtual application of these methods shows that FWI and ERT can be used to map the thin gas phase distribution in this heterogeneous formation with the individual methods conforming each other. However, a high spatial density of receivers in a crosswell geometry with less than 500 m distance between the observation wells is required for this. Gravity mapping also shows anomalies indicating mass changes caused by the storage operation. However, monitoring the filling state of this hydrogen storage site is not possible.},

	abstract = {In the context of Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS), the stored gas is in direct contact with brine (residual brine from the cavern or formation water of deep aquifers). Therefore, knowledge of the phase equilibria (solubility of hydrogen in brine and water content in the hydrogen-rich phase) in the geological reservoir is necessary for the study of hydrogen mobility and reactivity, as well as the control, monitoring and optimization of the storage. The absence of measured data of high-pressure H2 solubility in brine has recently led scientists to develop predictive models or to generate pseudo-data using molecular simulation. However, experimental measurements are needed for model evaluation and validation. In this work, an experimental apparatus based on the “static-analytic” method developed and used in our previous work for the measurement of gas solubility in brine was used. New solubility data of H2 in H2O+NaCl were measured more or less under the geological conditions of the storage, at temperatures between 323 and 373 K, NaCl molalities between 0 and 5m, and pressures up to 230 bar. These data were used to parameterize and evaluate three models (Geochemical, SW, and e-PR-CPA models) tested in this work. Solubility and water content tables were generated by the e-PR-CPA model, as well as a simple formulation (Setschenow-type relationship) for quick and accurate calculations (in the fitting range) of H2 solubility in water and brine was proposed. Finally, the developed models estimate very well the water content in hydrogen-rich phase and capture and calculate precisely the salting-out effect on H2 solubility.},

	abstract = {Increased emissions of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere has adversely been contributing to global warming as a result of burning fossil fuels. Therefore, the energy sectors have been looking into renewable sources such as wind, solar, and hydro energy to make electricity. However, the strongly fluctuating nature of electricity from such energy sources requires a bulk energy storage system to store the excess energy as a buffer and to fulfill the demand constantly. Underground storage is a proven way to store a huge amount of energy (electricity) after converting it into hydrogen as it has higher energy content per unit mass than other gases such as methane and natural gas. This paper reviews the technical aspects and feasibility of the underground storage of hydrogen into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, aquifers, and manmade underground cavity (caverns). Mechanisms of underground hydrogen storage (UHS) followed by numerous phenomena such as hydrodynamics, geochemical, physiochemical, bio-chemical, or microbial reactions have been deliberated. Modeling studies have also been incorporated in the literature to assess the feasibility of the process that are also reviewed in this paper. Worldwide ongoing lab study, field study together with potential storage sites have been reported as well. Technical challenges along with proper remedial techniques and economic viability have been briefly discussed. Finally, this paper delivers some feasible strategies for the underground hydrogen storage process, which would be helpful for future research and development of UHS.},

However, the intermittency associated with these systems presents a challenge to their effective implementation. This is estimated to lead to the curtailment of up to 7.72 TWh by 2030. Through electrolysis, this surplus can be stored chemically in the form of hydrogen to contribute to the 15 TWh required by 2050. The low density of hydrogen constrains above ground utility-scale storage systems and thus leads to exploration of the subsurface. This literature review describes the challenges and barriers, geological criteria and geographical availability of all utility-scale hydrogen storage technologies with a unique UK perspective. This is furthered by discussion of current research (primarily numerical models), with particular attention to porous storage as geographical constraints will necessitate its deployment within the UK.

In the search for suitable locations for this purpose it is useful to have the knowledge on the geological structures for underground storage of gases, including carbon dioxide. This article presents the possibilities of geological storage of hydrogen in underground geological structures in Poland (salt caverns, depleted oil and natural gas fields, and deeply seated aquifers). The study results confirm that there are favorable conditions to achieve this goal – in many areas of Poland it is possible to realize some type of hydrogen underground storage. The paper presents prospective areas for different options of hydrogen underground storage at specified conditions. For locations in salt caverns, rock salt deposits from the following areas are proposed: Łeba Elevation, Fore-Sudetic Monocline, Carpathian Foredeep, and salt stocks in the Polish Lowlands. For depleted oil and natural gas fields in the Polish Lowlands, Carpathians and Carpathian Foredeep, a few tens of fields are indicated, most of them are natural gas deposits. In the Polish Lowlands, several anticlinal structures in the Lower Cretaceous and Lower Jurassic formations have been selected. These pre-designated locations may be the basis for further work and detailed considerations in order to find the best and most appropriate locations intended for hydrogen underground storage.},

In such technical concept, surplus electricity is used to power electrolyzers that produce H2, which is then stored in subsurface formations to be used at times when renewable electricity is not available. Blending H2 with natural gas (NG) for injection into depleted gas/oil reservoirs, which are already used for NG storage, is considered a good option due to the lower initial capital cost and investment needed, and potential lower operating costs. In this study, the potential impact of storing a mixture of H2 and NG in an existing NG storage field was investigated. Relevant reservoir, caprock and cement samples from a NG storage formation in California were characterized with respect to their permeability, porosity, surface area, mineralogy and other structural characteristics, before and after undergoing 3-month incubation experiments with H2/NG gas mixtures at relevant temperature and pressure conditions. The results indicated relatively small changes in porosity and mineralogy due to incubation. However, the observed changes in permeability were more dramatic. In addition, polymeric materials, similar to those used in NG storage operations were also incubated, and their dimensions were measured before and after incubation. These measurements indicated swelling due to the exposure to H2. However, direct evidence of geochemical reactions involving H2 was not observed.},

	abstract = {Expectations for energy storage are high but large-scale underground hydrogen storage in porous media (UHSP) remains largely untested. This article identifies and discusses the scientific challenges of hydrogen storage in porous media for safe and efficient large-scale energy storage to enable a global hydrogen economy. To facilitate hydrogen supply on the scales required for a zero-carbon future, it must be stored in porous geological formations, such as saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. Large-scale UHSP offers the much-needed capacity to balance inter-seasonal discrepancies between demand and supply, decouple energy generation from demand and decarbonise heating and transport, supporting decarbonisation of the entire energy system. Despite the vast opportunity provided by UHSP, the maturity is considered low and as such UHSP is associated with several uncertainties and challenges. Here, the safety and economic impacts triggered by poorly understood key processes are identified, such as the formation of corrosive hydrogen sulfide gas, hydrogen loss due to the activity of microbes or permeability changes due to geochemical interactions impacting on the predictability of hydrogen flow through porous media. The wide range of scientific challenges facing UHSP are outlined to improve procedures and workflows for the hydrogen storage cycle, from site selection to storage site operation. Multidisciplinary research, including reservoir engineering, chemistry, geology and microbiology, more complex than required for CH4 or CO2 storage is required in order to implement the safe, efficient and much needed large-scale commercial deployment of UHSP.},

	abstract = {Poor understanding of the flow behavior of granular biomass material poses great challenges for the bioenergy industry, as the equipment functioning time is significantly reduced by handling issues like screw feeder clogging and hopper arching. In this work, the flow behavior of loblolly pine chips, including the mass flow rate and the critical outlet width, in a wedge-shaped hopper is investigated by combining physical experiments and numerical simulations. Comprehensive characterization of the flow response affected by the two material attributes (initial packing, particle density) and the three operational parameters (hopper outlet width, hopper inclination, and surcharge) is conducted. The results show that the hopper outlet width linearly controls the mass flow rate, while the hopper inclination angle controls the critical outlet size. The packing determines whether the flow is smooth or surging, and the surcharge-induced compaction creates flow impedance. The magnitude of these influences varies from a slender hopper with a low inclination angle to a flat-bottom silo. These findings provide guidance for hopper operation in the material handling industry and shed light on the construction of a novel design method for material handling equipment in biorefineries.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage in porous geological formations is a potential option to mitigate offsets between power demand and generation in an energy system largely based on renewables. Incorporating hydrogen storage into the energy network requires the consideration of multiple scenarios for storage settings and potential loading cycles, causing a high computational effort. Therefore, homogenous replacement models are constructed by applying different spatial averaging methods for permeability and linearized relative permeability to an ensemble of heterogeneous reservoir representations of a potential hydrogen storage site. The applicability of these replacement models for approximating storage characteristics, such as well flow rates, pressure changes and power rates, is investigated by comparing their results to the results of the full heterogeneous ensemble. It is found that using the arithmetic mean to estimate the lateral and the harmonic mean for the vertical permeability in the homogeneous replacement models provides an approximation to the median of the heterogeneous ensemble for pressure changes, storage flow rate, gas in place and power output. Basic time-dependent effects of reducing well flow, and thus the power rates, during an extraction cycle can also be represented by these homogeneous replacement models. Using geometric means is found not to yield a valid representation of the storage behaviour.},

Results demonstrate that underground hydrogen storage in saline aquifers can be operated with reasonable recovery ratios. A maximum hydrogen recovery ratio of 78\%, which represents a global energy efficiency of 30\%, has been estimated.

The conversion of electricity into hydrogen for storage and transport is an efficient technological solution, capable of significantly reducing the problem of energy shortage. Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is the best solution to store the large amount of excess electrical energy arising from the excessive over-production of electricity, with the objective of balancing the irregular and intermittent energy production, typical of renewable sources such as windmills or solar. Earlier studies have demonstrated that UHS should be qualitatively identical to the underground storage of natural gas. Much later, however, it was revealed that UHS is bound to incur peculiar difficulties, as the stored hydrogen is likely to be used by the microorganisms present in the rocks for their metabolism, which may cause significant losses of hydrogen. This paper demonstrates that besides microbial activities, the hydrodynamic behavior of UHS is very unique and different from that of a natural gas storage.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage in a depleted gas reservoir or in an aquifer offers the potential for the seasonal storage of inherently variable renewable energy, by the electrolysis of water during periods of excess energy production. Here we investigate whether such storage is technically feasible. We compared the respective capacities and deliverabilities of hydrogen to established natural gas in a seasonal storage facility, on the basis of an estimated total volumetric capacity of 48 MMm3, delivery pressures between 5 and 10 MPa and emptying period of 120 days for the Rough Gas Storage Facility (UK). For the modelled scenario, an average power in the order of 4–5 GW would be required during a six month injection cycle to fill the reservoir to capacity. The equivalent hydrogen facility could store and supply 42\% of the energy capacity supplied by its natural gas counterpart, and for an emptying period of 120 days could deliver power at an average rate of approximately 100 GWh/day, or ca. 40\% of the energy deliverability of natural gas. There appears to be no insurmountable technical barrier to the storage of hydrogen in a depleted gas reservoir. Hydrogen losses from dissolution and diffusion could be reduced to less than 0.1\%. Losses from biological conversion of residual CO2 were limited even with calcium carbonate dissolution. However, the biological reduction of sulphur minerals to hydrogen sulphide remained a potential problem.},

	abstract = {The storage of hydrogen in underground reservoirs comprises a potential solution for balancing the fluctuating energy production from wind and solar power plants. In this concept, electrolysers are used to transform excessively produced electrical energy into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen. The resulting large volumes of hydrogen are temporarily stored in subsurface formations purely or in mixture with other gases. In times of high energy demand, the chemical energy is transformed back into electricity by fuel cells or engine generators. Key aspects in the development period and the subsequent cyclic operations of such a storage are the hydrodynamic behavior of hydrogen and its interaction with residual fluids in the reservoir. Mathematically, the behavior can be described by a compositional two-phase flow model with water and gas as phases and all relevant chemical species as components (H2, H2O, CH4, CO2, N2, H2S, etc.). The spatial variation of the gas phase composition between injected and initial gas leads to density and viscosity contrasts which influence the displacement process. The mixing of gases with different compositions is governed by molecular diffusion or mechanical dispersion dependent on the flow velocity. In the present paper, a numerical case study in a depleted gas reservoir was performed. The storage was charged with hydrogen for 5 years.

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage in depleted gas fields is a promising option for the large-scale storage of excess renewable energy. In the framework of the hydrogen storage assessment for the “Underground Sun Storage” project, we conduct a multi-step geochemical modelling approach to study fluid–rock interactions by means of equilibrium and kinetic batch simulations. With the equilibrium approach, we estimate the long-term consequences of hydrogen storage, whereas kinetic models are used to investigate the interactions between hydrogen and the formation on the time scales of typical storage cycles. The kinetic approach suggests that reactions of hydrogen with minerals become only relevant over timescales much longer than the considered storage cycles. The final kinetic model considers both mineral reactions and hydrogen dissolution to be kinetically controlled. Interactions among hydrogen and aqueous-phase components seem to be dominant within the storage-relevant time span. Additionally, sensitivity analyses of hydrogen dissolution kinetics, which we consider to be the controlling parameter of the overall reaction system, were performed. Reliable data on the kinetic rates of mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions, specifically in the presence of hydrogen, are scarce and often not representative of the studied conditions. These uncertainties in the kinetic rates for minerals such as pyrite and pyrrhotite were investigated and are discussed in the present work. The proposed geochemical workflow provides valuable insight into controlling mechanisms and risk evaluation of hydrogen storage projects and may serve as a guideline for future investigations.},

	abstract = {The intermittent production of the renewable energy imposes the necessity to temporarily store it. Large amounts of exceeding electricity can be stored in geological strata in the form of hydrogen. The conversion of hydrogen to electricity and vice versa can be performed in electrolyzers and fuel elements by chemical methods. The nowadays technical solution accepted by the European industry consists of injecting small concentrations of hydrogen in the existing storages of natural gas. The progressive development of this technology will finally lead to the creation of underground storages of pure hydrogen. Due to the low viscosity and low density of hydrogen, it is expected that the problem of an unstable displacement, including viscous fingering and gravity overriding, will be more pronounced. Additionally, the injection of hydrogen in geological strata could encounter chemical reactivity induced by various species of microorganisms that consume hydrogen for their metabolism. One of the products of such reactions is methane, produced from Sabatier reaction between H2 and CO2. Other hydrogenotrophic reactions could be caused by acetogenic archaea, sulfate-reducing bacteria and iron-reducing bacteria. In the present paper, a mathematical model is presented which is capable to reflect the coupled hydrodynamic and bio-chemical processes in UHS. The model has been numerically implemented by using the open source code DuMuX developed by the University of Stuttgart. The obtained bio-chemical version of DuMuX was used to model the evolution of a hypothetical underground storage of hydrogen. We have revealed that the behavior of an underground hydrogen storage is different than that of a natural gas storage. Both, the hydrodynamic and the bio-chemical effects, contribute to the different characteristics.},

This study presents for the first time, a globally applicable source to sink methodology and analysis that matches geological storage capacity with energy demand. As a case study, it is applied to the domestic heating system in the UK, with a focus on maintaining the existing gas distribution network. To balance the significant annual cyclicity in energy demand for heating, hydrogen could be stored in gas fields offshore and transported via offshore pipelines to the existing gas terminals into the gas network. The hydrogen energy storage demand in the UK is estimated to be {\textasciitilde}77.9 terawatt-hour (TWh), which is approximately 25\% of the total energy from natural gas used for domestic heating. The total estimated storage capacity of the gas fields included in this study is 2661.9 TWh. The study reveals that only a few offshore gas fields are required to store enough energy as hydrogen to balance the entire seasonal demand for UK domestic heating. It also demonstrates that as so few fields are required, hydrogen storage will not compete for the subsurface space required for other low-carbon subsurface applications, such as carbon storage or compressed air energy storage.},

These projects are also focused on fixed offshore wind turbines at depths of less than 50m. The design conservatism observed is present to avoid many changes to the proven technology on land-based wind turbines and offshore fixed foundations, to assure technical feasibility and economic viability in the short term. However, exportation of onshore technology directly to the offshore environment may not be entirely advantageous. There are opportunities in new designs or configurations, which can potentially lower cost of energy in a less restrictive offshore environment. This paper aims to review the current offshore wind technology and discusses comprehensively some of the factors and opportunities in selecting a downwind configuration for offshore wind turbines. In addition, current industry, research and developmental trends for downwind offshore wind turbines are described.

The overall damping of OWTs plays an important role in the design process as it limits the amplitude of the OWT dynamic response at frequencies near resonance. Therefore, an accurate estimation of OWTs damping is necessary for the efficient design of these systems. The foundation damping is one of the main sources overall turbine damping and is the least well understood. This paper presents a critical review of recently published studies on foundation damping for OWTs on monopiles and explains how soil damping contributes to the total damping of OWTs. It also reviews the main methods that have been used for the estimation of foundation damping in numerical and experimental studies. In addition, the importance of damping to the OWTs fatigue life is discussed. Finally, a discussion is provided on the challenges to be overcome and recommendations for the accurate estimation of foundation damping.},

	abstract = {The present paper studies the soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects on the dynamic properties of offshore wind turbines (OWT) founded on monopiles. For that purpose, a three degrees-of-freedom substructuring model based on modal parameters is proposed. The whole superstructure is reduced to a punctual mass by its fundamental modal mass and height, while the pile-soil stiffness is represented by the corresponding impedance functions. The proposed model, together with characteristic relations between the fixed-base fundamental frequency and the modal parameters obtained from data of existent OWTs found in the literature, is used to analyse the influence of the superstructure and foundation dimensions and soil profile on the magnitude of the SSI phenomena. The obtained results confirm the relevance of including the foundation stiffness in the design stage of OWT systems, as variations in the fundamental frequency close to 15\% can be produced. The homogeneous assumption, even if cs,30 mean values are assumed, yields to misleading results if the actual soil profile presents properties that vary with depth. The superficial layers of the soil profile are found to play a major role in the estimation of the OWT system fundamental frequency and damping when the SSI phenomena are included.},

Damping in an offshore wind turbine originates from different sources, mainly, aerodynamic, structural, hydrodynamic, and soil dampings. The difficulties in identifying the individual contribution from each damping source have led to considerable uncertainty and variation in the values recommended. This paper proposes simplified but direct modelling approaches to quantify the damping contributions from the aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and soil interactions. Results from these models were systemically compared to published values and when appropriate with simulation results from the software package FAST. The range of values obtained for aerodynamic damping confirmed those available in the literature, and blade element modelling theory was shown to provide good results relatively efficiently. The influence of couplings between fore-aft and side-side directions on the aerodynamic damping contribution was highlighted. The modelling of hydrodynamic damping showed that this damping is much smaller than usually recommended and could be safely ignored for offshore wind turbines. Soil damping strongly depends on the soil specific nonlinear behaviour.},

	abstract = {Increasing the share of renewable energy is an important aim of Germany’s energy policy. Offshore wind energy is expected to be one of the main sources of future electricity supply. Compared to onshore conditions, offshore wind speeds are high and steady and so high yields can be expected. German wind farm projects are mainly planned in locations far off the coast and in deep water. They are situated in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Federal Republic of Germany which extends from the 12-nautical mile line up to 200 nautical miles from the coast into the ocean. The conditions for the erection of offshore wind turbines (OWT) with water depths up to 50 m, high wind and wave loads are very demanding. Consequently the ongoing construction of OWT in Germany is globally unique. These difficult boundary conditions call for careful planning. The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH), as the competent authority, has to date granted approval for 39 wind farms and 10 converter platforms. The BSH issues standards which serve as technical codes for offshore wind turbines. The Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute (BAW) is the consultant to BSH on geotechnical matters – among others – related to OWTs. According to the BSH standard for the design of offshore wind turbines (BSH 2015), German and European standards (Eurocode, DIN 1054) already introduced by the construction supervision authorities have priority over other standards and regulations. This paper gives an overview of challenges that are met during the design and the installation of OWTs from a geotechnical perspective such as scour formation, adverse soil conditions as well as geotechnical limit state analysis for offshore structures. It reveals that there is a need for fundamental research in geotechnical engineering as well as hydraulical and structural engineering in order to construct OWTs more economically and safe at the same time.},

The examples are chosen to illustrate some general points about foundation design, geotechnical engineering and its interaction with other disciplines. The first example is drawn from the assessment of the safety of installation of jack-up units (large mobile offshore drilling rigs). It illustrates how more rational approaches can be achieved through a deeper use of probabilistic methods in both the prediction of performance and the assessment of field observations. The second example also comes from jack-up practice, but has wider application too: it addresses the classical problem of the performance of foundations under combined loading, and how this can be understood in a simple theoretical and practical framework based on plasticity theory. The final example comes from the renewables sector, where the rapidly expanding offshore wind industry poses new foundation challenges for geotechnical engineers. Practical and economic foundation solutions are required if the UK is to meet its ambitious plans to exploit larger turbines in deeper waters. Both conventional (monopile) and novel solutions (suction caissons, screw piles) to the foundation problem are discussed. The paper also demonstrates how interactions with other disciplines can enrich geotechnical engineering, illustrated by specific practical examples from the author's experience.},

	abstract = {Designing foundations for Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs) are challenging as these are dynamically sensitive structures in the sense that natural frequencies of these structures are very close to the forcing frequencies of the wind, wave and 1P (rotor frequency) and 2P/3P (blade shadowing frequency) loading. Typically for the widely used soft-stiff design (target frequency of the overall wind turbine is between 1P and 2P/3P), the ratio of forcing frequency to natural frequency is very close to 1 and as a result is prone to dynamic amplification of responses such as deflection/rotation which may enhance the fatigue damage, thereby reducing the intended design life. Therefore, a designer apart from accurately predicting the natural frequency of the structure, must also ensure that the overall natural frequency due to dynamic-soil-structure-interaction does not shift towards the forcing frequencies making the value of ݂ ௙ /݂ ௡ even closer to 1. Therefore foundations are one of critical components of Offshore Wind Turbines not only because of the overall stability of the structure but also due to financial viability of the project.

In the present study, three-dimensional finite-element (FE) analyses are performed to estimate the static lateral load-carrying capacity of monopiles in dense sand subjected to eccentric loading. A modified Mohr–Coulomb (MMC) model that considers prepeak hardening, postpeak softening, and the effects of mean effective stress and relative density on stress–strain behavior of dense sand is adopted in the FE analysis. FE analyses are also performed with the Mohr–Coulomb (MC) model. The load–displacement behavior observed in model tests can be simulated better with the MMC model than with the MC model. On the basis of a parametric study for different length-to-diameter ratios of the pile, load–moment capacity interaction diagrams were developed for different degrees of rotation. A simplified model, based on the concept of lateral pressure distribution on the pile, is also proposed for the estimation of its capacity.},

	abstract = {With increasing demand of energy, attention to the alternative sources of sustainable energy is getting priority over the last decades. Offshore wind turbine is one of them. The most widely used foundation system for the wind turbine is the monopile, which is a large diameter single pile. In the present study, three-dimensional finite element (FE) analyses are performed to evaluate the capacity of large diameter monopiles in dense sand using the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach available in Abaqus/Explicit FE software. The behavior of sand is modeled using the Mohr-Coulomb (MC) and a modified Mohr-Coulomb (MMC) model where the pre-peak hardening, post-peak softening and the effects of mean effective stress and relative density on stress-strain behavior of dense sand are considered. Comparison with physical model test results shows that the MMC model can simulate better the load-displacement response than that with the MC model. The mechanisms involved in soil deformation are also explained using FE results.

	abstract = {Offshore wind turbine towers experience large base moments because of wind and wave loading. The flexibility of the foundation should be considered when analyzing the structural response of towers. Previous studies showed that conventional p–y curves are not suitable in designing the foundation. More advanced methods, such as the finite element method, are necessary to model the offshore wind turbine foundation. In addition, these studies focused on the analysis of the foundation itself, so the effect on the structural response of the tower merits further research. The present study aimed to compare different foundation modeling approaches, focusing on their effects on the structural response of the wind turbine tower. We integrated wind turbine aerodynamic simulation with different models of the foundation. We confirmed that ignoring the flexibility of the foundation caused significant error in wind turbine tower behavior. Between the p–y curve-based model and finite element-based model, the change in maximum moment was insignificant, but the maximum tilt angle increased over 14\% in the finite element model. Therefore, the finite element approach is recommended to obtain a conservative design when large tilt angles may cause serviceability issues.},

The model is verified by observation data obtained from laboratory experiments. On the basis of the simulations, the factors affecting the scour depth, including the effects of incipient velocity, pipe diameter and sediment particle size and so on, were investigated.

As a first task, the numerical model was calibrated by comparing its results of scour against two sets of data, the first one obtained from numerical simulations and the second one from experimental tests. From these results it was possible to define the closure model of turbulence and a relaxation coefficient on the bed load equation necessary to increase the mobility of the sediments in the vicinity of the pile. Once the model was calibrated, a set of numerical simulations of pile scour under unsteady flow and oscillatory flow was performed using different hydrographs and wave conditions. There is a strong agreement between the simulated data and the experimental data reported by other authors for unsteady flow. In the case of scour associated with oscillatory flow, the numerical results showed the same statistical behavior as the experimental data previously published by others. When the numerical results are analyzed according to the Keulegan-Carpenter number, they represent the scour phenomenon in the same order of magnitude of the experiments. A conclusion of the study is the necessity to improve the sediment transport description, in order to avoid the use of a dedicated relaxation coefficient that reduces the threshold condition of the incipient transport.},

	abstract = {The driven monopile is the most common foundation type for all installed offshore wind turbines. These monopiles are often subject to scour phenomena, which cause a reduction in foundation strength and stiffness. In order to prevent the consequences of this phenomenon, scour protection systems are used to protect the seabed around a monopile structure against scour in practice. This paper presents a numerical model to investigate the effect of scour protection on the natural frequency and lateral responses of monopile-supported offshore wind turbines under the ultimate limit state (ULS), serviceability limit state (SLS) and fatigue limit state (FLS). This numerical model was validated through a series of model tests, and then applied to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5-MW offshore wind turbine supported on an Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration (OC3) monopile with riprap rock scour protection system. The study concludes that the scour protection has a slight impact on the first natural frequency and monopile behavior under ULS and FLS. However, the scour protection significantly decreases the pile head rotation at mudline under SLS, which provides the opportunity for further optimization of monopile design by incorporating the contribution of scour protection, thereby leading to a more economical design.},

	abstract = {For the transition to a clean and sustainable energy production from renewable sources like solar or wind power, large and secure storage of energy is required to compensate for the intermittent nature of these sources. Hydrogen could be a suitable energy carrier and hydrogen geological storage could provide the large capacities required. During storage hydrogen will be brought in contact with the formation fluids present, resulting in dissolution and possibly inducing geochemical reactions. Therefore in this work an accurate, consistent and reliable hydrogen solubility model is established, which allows to calculate the hydrogen solubility in the formation fluid and the corresponding variation of fluid density. The model accounts for system pressure, temperature and formation fluid salinity as well as the molar fraction, fugacity coefficient, Henry's constant, Poynting factor and activity coefficient of hydrogen. In the range of typical hydrogen geological storage conditions of 273–373 K, 1–50 MPa and 0–5 mol/kg NaCl this model can reproduce all available experimental data and predict hydrogen solubility in the formation fluid and the formation fluid density accurately. The model can predict hydrogen solubility within a maximum relative error of 5\% for pure water and 15\% for brines within the salinity range considered, which is in the range of uncertainty of measurement data. For realistic hydrogen gas geological storage, the model is extended to represent also H2-N2 or H2-CH4 mixed gas systems as well as mixed electrolyte solutions containing Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl or SO4 and combinations of those. Model derivation, model calculations and implementation as well as an application example are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the developed methods and the model.},

Characterizations included particle size and shape distributions, bulk density, compressibility at 10 kPa uniaxial pressure, elastic recovery from 10 kPa uniaxial pressure, shear strength, effective angle of internal friction, arching in a custom hopper, and feeding performance in an auger feeder operating separately in volumetric and gravimetric feeding modes. Compressibility and elastic recovery increased as much as 15\% and 4\%, respectively with increasing MC. Adding 3 kPa of pressure increased the minimum hopper outlet width needed to ensure consistent ﬂow (i.e. the critical arching width) for all hopper arching tests, except for the pellets. Interestingly, for materials with smaller particle sizes, the volumetric feed rate tends to decrease as MC increases even though the density of the material increases with MC. Time variability of volumetric feed rate increased dramatically with increasing particle size but the impact of MC was not as clear. For nearly all tests, gravimetric auger feeding resulted in better feeding control and substantially decreased time variability in the material feed rate. Shear tests indicate that material strength generally decreased with increasing particle size; while the impact of MC was not as obvious. Agreement between experiments and predictions of the critical arching width were best for 1.6 mm and 6 mm grinds and worst for the 13 mm grinds. This work also shows that the correlation between experiments and predictions of the critical arching width can be improved in terms of the coefﬁcient of determination (R2) from 0.56 to 0.84 by correlating the respective upper limits of the 95\% conﬁdence intervals rather than the mean values.},

	abstract = {Thermophilic and hyperthermophilic Archaea and Bacteria have been isolated from marine hydrothermal systems, heated sediments, continental solfataras, hot springs, water heaters, and industrial waste. They catalyze a tremendous array of widely varying metabolic processes. As determined in the laboratory, electron donors in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic microbial redox reactions include H2, Fe2, H2S, S, S2O233, S4O263, sulfide minerals, CH4, various mono-, di-, and hydroxy-carboxylic acids, alcohols, amino acids, and complex organic substrates ; electron acceptors include O2, Fe3, CO2, CO, NO33 , NO32 , NO, N2O, SO243, SO233, S2O233, and S. Although many assimilatory and dissimilatory metabolic reactions have been identified for these groups of microorganisms, little attention has been paid to the energetics of these reactions. In this review, standard molal Gibbs free energies (vG0r ) as a function of temperature to 200³C are tabulated for 370 organic and inorganic redox, disproportionation, dissociation, hydrolysis, and solubility reactions directly or indirectly involved in microbial metabolism. To calculate values of vG0r for these and countless other reactions, the apparent standard molal Gibbs free energies of formation (vG0) at temperatures to 200³C are given for 307 solids, liquids, gases, and aqueous solutes. It is shown that values of vG0r for many microbially mediated reactions are highly temperature dependent, and that adopting values determined at 25³C for systems at elevated temperatures introduces significant and unnecessary errors. The metabolic processes considered here involve compounds that belong to the following chemical systems: H{\textasciicircum}O, H{\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum}N, H{\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum}S, H{\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum}N{\textasciicircum}S, H{\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum}Cinorganic, H{\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum}C, H{\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum}N{\textasciicircum}C, H{\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum}S{\textasciicircum}C, H{\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum} N{\textasciicircum}S{\textasciicircum}Camino acids, H{\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum}S{\textasciicircum}C{\textasciicircum}metals/minerals, and H{\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum}P. For four metabolic reactions of particular interest in thermophily and hyperthermophily (knallgas reaction, anaerobic sulfur and nitrate reduction, and autotrophic methanogenesis), values of the overall Gibbs free energy (vGr) as a function of temperature are calculated for a wide range of chemical compositions likely to be present in near-surface and deep hydrothermal and geothermal systems. ß 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

	abstract = {DualSPHysics is a weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) Navier–Stokes solver initially conceived to deal with coastal engineering problems, especially those related to wave impact with coastal structures. Since the first release back in 2011, DualSPHysics has shown to be robust and accurate for simulating extreme wave events along with a continuous improvement in efficiency thanks to the exploitation of hardware such as graphics processing units for scientific computing or the coupling with wave propagating models such as SWASH and OceanWave3D. Numerous additional functionalities have also been included in the DualSPHysics package over the last few years which allow the simulation of fluid-driven objects. The use of the discrete element method has allowed the solver to simulate the interaction among different bodies (sliding rocks, for example), which provides a unique tool to analyse debris flows. In addition, the recent coupling with other solvers like Project Chrono or MoorDyn has been a milestone in the development of the solver. Project Chrono allows the simulation of articulated structures with joints, hinges, sliders and springs and MoorDyn allows simulating moored structures. Both functionalities make DualSPHysics especially suited for the simulation of offshore energy harvesting devices. Lately, the present state of maturity of the solver goes beyond single-phase simulations, allowing multi-phase simulations with gas–liquid and a combination of Newtonian and non-Newtonian models expanding further the capabilities and range of applications for the DualSPHysics solver. These advances and functionalities make DualSPHysics an advanced meshless solver with emphasis on free-surface flow modelling.},

	abstract = {Tidal stream energy has the potential to contribute to global renewable energy generation, but this remains largely untapped. Technical developments have helped create a nascent industry with several pre-commercial installations. However, planned projects experience a cautious investment climate due to perceived risk of failure, and maintenance and repair cost. This paper reviews 58 tidal stream energy deployments between 2003 and August 2020. The analysis reviews commonalities, success and engineering issues, to inform current and future projects. The work classifies each deployment by type, rated power, number of devices, grid connection and foundation. In each case, project status and (if appropriate) failure mode is identified. Failure modes are compared to deployment classification to identify potential relationships. Most deployments were of horizontal axis turbines. The majority (54\%) of deployments performed well. 18\% failed, 14\% were withdrawn from service, and 14\% generated less power than planned. The most common failure cause was blade failure, followed by generator and monitoring failures. Ducted devices and devices in high velocity locations were more likely to fail, suggesting that flow velocity is a key factor. Most blade failures were attributed to underestimation of loads during design. Floating deployments were less likely to fail than fixed deployments, but more likely to be curtailed. Off-grid and grid connected deployments showed similar failure rates, suggesting sector immaturity. Tidal stream energy has accumulated around 1.4 million operating hours. Analysis shows a falling empirical failure rate, and likelihood of failure similar to that experienced by the wind industry at a similar stage. This work will be useful for project planners, developers and technology companies and investors in de-risking future project efforts.},

	abstract = {The monopile foundations of offshore wind turbines in shallow waters are susceptible to be affected by tidal scour, which takes away the sand and soil around the monopiles and poses a serious threat to the safety of the turbines. To mitigate this issue, much effort has been made previously. However, all of the existing protective measures do not have added value other than scouring mitigation. In view of this, a new scour mitigation measure that utilizes tidal current turbine (TCT) is investigated in this study, which can not only reduce the scour around the wind turbine foundation but can also generate clean power simultaneously. In the research, the proposed method is studied by using a combined numerical simulation and laboratory testing approach. Both numerical calculation and experimental results have shown that a TCT installed in front of the monopile foundation of an offshore wind turbine does have a positive role in reducing the scour around the foundation when it generates electricity in the meantime. Moreover, the contribution of the TCT to scour reduction can be further improved through optimizing its installation position in front of the wind turbine.},

Accurate estimation of the thermodynamic and transport properties of H2 mixed with other gases found within the storage system is therefore essential for the efficient design for the processes involved in this system chain. In this study, we used the established and regarded GERG-2008 Equation of State (EoS) and SuperTRAPP model to predict the thermo-physical properties of H2 mixed with CH4, N2, CO2, and a typical natural gas from the North-Sea. The data covers a wide range of mole fraction of H2 (10–90 Mole\%), pressures (0.01–100 MPa), and temperatures (200–500 K) with high accuracy and precision. Moreover, to increase ease of access to the data, a user-friendly software (H2Themobank) is developed and made publicly available.},

	abstract = {The deployment of diverse energy storage technologies, with the combination of daily, weekly and seasonal storage dynamics, allows for the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per unit energy provided. In particular, the production, storage and re-utilization of hydrogen starting from renewable energy has proven to be one of the most promising solutions for offsetting seasonal mismatch between energy generation and consumption. A realistic possibility for large-scale hydrogen storage, suitable for long-term storage dynamics, is presented by salt caverns. In this contribution, we provide a framework for modeling underground hydrogen storage, with a focus on salt caverns, and we evaluate its potential for reducing the CO2 emissions within an integrated energy systems context. To this end, we develop a first-principle model, which accounts for the transport phenomena within the rock and describes the dynamics of the stored energy when injecting and withdrawing hydrogen. Then, we derive a linear reduced order model that can be used for mixed-integer linear program optimization while retaining an accurate description of the storage dynamics under a variety of operating conditions. Using this new framework, we determine the minimum-emissions design and operation of a multi-energy system with H2 storage. Ultimately, we assess the potential of hydrogen storage for reducing CO2 emissions when different capacities for renewable energy production and energy storage are available, mapping emissions regions on a plane defined by storage capacity and renewable generation. We extend the analysis for solar- and wind-based energy generation and for different energy demands, representing typical profiles of electrical and thermal demands, and different CO2 emissions associated with the electric grid.},

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) appears to be an important means as a large-scale and long-term energy storage solution. A primary concern of UHS is the in-situ geochemical reactions-induced hydrogen loss. In this context, we performed geochemical modelling to examine the hydrogen loss associated with hydrogen dissolution and fluid-rock interactions using PHREEQC (Version 3) as a function of temperature and pressure. We also performed geochemical modelling with kinetics to investigate the potential hydrogen loss in two commercial gas storage reservoirs (Tubridgi and Mondarra) in Western Australia against the reservoir mineralogy, fluid properties, depth and temperature. Our results show that increasing pressure and temperature only slightly increases hydrogen solubility in brines without minerals. Increasing salinity slightly decreases the solubility of hydrogen in brines. The saturated hydrogen aqueous solution almost does not react with silicate and clay minerals, which is favorable for underground hydrogen storage in quartz-rich sandstone reservoirs. However, unlike silicate and clay minerals, carbonates like calcite triggers up to 9.5\% hydrogen loss due to calcite dissolution induced hydrogen dissociation process. Kinetic simulations show that Tubridgi only leads to 0.72\% of hydrogen loss, and Mondarra causes 2.76\% of hydrogen loss as a result of reservoir calcite dissolution and hydrogen dissociation in brines in 30-year time. Nearly over 87\% of calcite cement from Mondarra may be dissolved in 30-year, suggesting potential risks associated with wellbore stability. In conclusion, geochemical reactions-induced hydrogen loss would be minor for UHS in porous media, and we argue that deep calcite-free reservoirs together with calcite-free caprocks would be preferable for underground hydrogen storage.},

	abstract = {Summary The energy transition from fossil and nuclear energy towards an energy supply system from renewable sources will require an enormous extension of the existing energy storage capacity. For this intention depleted oil and gas reservoirs could play a key role when they are used as storage reservoirs for hydrogen or other energy carriers in a seasonal or more frequent cycle. In previous studies it was shown that chemical reactions catalyzed by anaerobic microorganisms and mixing phenomena between gases with different composition have important influences in underground storage of hydrogen. In particular hydrogenotrophic microorganisms could produce methane by metabolizing hydrogen and carbon dioxide. To describe these effects a model was developed which couples the compositional two-phase transport of gas and water to microbial population dynamics and bio-chemical reactions. In this work the numerical model was applied to a field scale storage scenario using a real geological model and several storage operation wells. The complex multi-physical model applied on around 200.000 grid cells results in approximately 2 million degrees of freedom. In addition the strong coupling between the microbial population dynamics and transport of chemical components is numerically difficult to handle and consequently small times steps not larger than one or two days have to be calculated. To overcome the computational effort the simulation study was executed on a high performance computing cluster. The interpretation of the simulation results shows that a significant amount of the stored hydrogen was transformed into methane due to the bio-chemical reactions. In addition it was demonstrated that the produced gas contains H2S in the range of some parts per thousand when sulfate reducing bacteria were present.},

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen storage can store grid-scale energy for balancing both short-term and long-term inter-seasonal supply and demand. However, there is no numerical simulator which is dedicated to the design and optimisation of such energy storage technology at grid scale. This study develops novel simulation capabilities for GPSFLOW (General Purpose Subsurface Flow Simulator) for modelling grid-scale hydrogen and gas mixture (e.g., H2–CO2–CH4–N2) storage in cavern, deep saline aquifers and depleted gas fields. The accuracy of GPSFLOW is verified by comparisons against the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) online thermophysical database and reported lab experiments, over a range of temperatures from 20 to 200 °C and pressure up to 1000 bar. The simulator is benchmarked against an existing model for modelling pure H2 storage in a synthetic aquifer. Several underground hydrogen storage scenarios including H2 storage in a synthetic salt cavern, H2 injection into a CH4-saturated aquifer experiment, and hydrogen storage in a depleted gas field using CO2 as a cushion gas are used to test the GPSFLOW's modelling capability. The results show that GPSFLOW offers a robust numerical tool to model underground hydrogen storage and gas mixture at grid scale on multiple parallel computing platforms.},

One important factor which influences this technology is the activity of methanogenic microorganisms capable of utilising hydrogen and carbon dioxide for metabolism and leading to a change in the stored gas composition. A coupled, pore-scale model is presented which aids in the investigation of the mechanisms that govern the conversion of hydrogen to methane, i.e. advective hydrogen flow, its diffusion into microbial biofilms of multiple species, and its consumption within these biofilms. The model assumes that spherical grains are coated by a film of residual water and treats the biofilm development within each film in a quasi one-dimensional manner. A sample simulation using the presented model illustrates the biofilm growth process in these films as well as the competition between three different microbial species: methanogens, acetogens, and acetotrophs.},

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen storage is a potential way to balance seasonal ﬂuctuations in energy production from renewable energies. The risks of hydrogen storage in depleted gas ﬁelds include the conversion of hydrogen to CH4(g) and H2S(g) due to microbial activity, gas–water–rock interactions in the reservoir and cap rock, which are connected with porosity changes, and the loss of aqueous hydrogen by diffusion through the cap rock brine. These risks lead to loss of hydrogen and thus to a loss of energy. A hydrogeochemical modeling approach is developed to analyze these risks and to understand the basic hydrogeochemical mechanisms of hydrogen storage over storage times at the reservoir scale. The one-dimensional diffusive mass transport model is based on equilibrium reactions for gas–water–rock interactions and kinetic reactions for sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. The modeling code is PHREEQC (pH-REdox-EQuilibrium written in the C programming language). The parameters that inﬂuence the hydrogen loss are identiﬁed. Crucial parameters are the amount of available electron acceptors, the storage time, and the kinetic rate constants. Hydrogen storage causes a slight decrease in porosity of the reservoir rock. Loss of aqueous hydrogen by diffusion is minimal. A wide range of conditions for optimized hydrogen storage in depleted gas ﬁelds is identiﬁed.},

	abstract = {A robust computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model accounting for both spatial and temporal dynamics of a subsurface vertical flow treatment wetland system was developed by combining fluid transport, solute transport, biokinetics, biofilm development, and biofilm detachment/sloughing using COMSOL Multiphysics™. The local porosity of the porous media was calculated based on the estimated biofilm development over time. The biofilm development sub-model considered both organic pollutant metabolism/degradation as a mechanism for microbial growth and the effect of fluid shear stress on the local biofilm detachment. The influence of biofilm accumulation on the permeability of the porous media was considered using the Kozeney–Carman relation. The permeability of the porous media was estimated by calibrating the model against experimental tracer data that had been collected in a full water-recirculation batch operation. As the biofilm developed from start-up, removal efficiency of readily biodegradable organic matter improved during the first 10 weeks of operation while no significant change was predicted after 10 weeks. A dead-zone region was predicted near the bottom of the system opposite to the outflow port after 100 days of operation attributed to exponential biofilm growth and low biofilm detachment rates. A decrease of 95\% in the advective transport of organic matter in the dead-zone region occurred after 280 days of operation. No appreciable biofilm accumulation was predicted in the region near the outlet due to the high fluid shear stress acting on the biofilm surface. The averaged porosity of the mesocosm decreased by 6.6\% after 365 days of operation while the local porosity in the dead-zone region decreased by 71\%. Good agreement was found between the averaged porosity of the entire system and experimental data. This is the first model to integrate hydrodynamics, solute transport, biokinetics relating to pollutant removal, biofilm development, and biofilm detachment into a comprehensive model. Although computationally intensive, this is the first model to predict bio-clogging processes in a spatial manner similar to what would be realistically expected.},

Recent finite element analysis models can now simulate clogging development in subsurface-flow treatment wetlands with reasonable accuracy. Various management strategies have been developed to extend the life of clogged treatment wetlands, including gravel excavation and/or washing, chemical treatment, and application of earthworms.

	abstract = {Standard integration schemes for rate constitutive equations were designed within the classical theory of plasticity. Consequently, they rely on the assumption that a yield criterion defines a range of purely elastic material behaviour. Many constitutive models for non-cohesive soils discard that assumption. They account for inelastic deformations without employing a yield criterion. This simplifies the formulation of the models but raises questions concerning their numerical implementation. In particular, it is not fully clear which algorithmic method is most appropriate for the numerical integration of constitutive models without elastic range. To investigate this, two different stress point algorithms for a critical state bounding surface model for sands were developed and implemented. The explicit method employs substepping to automatically control the local error. The implicit method updates stresses and state variables through a local Newton iteration, the Jacobian of which is computed by numerical differentiation. The two algorithms were compared by means of calculations at integration point level as well as with respect to a boundary value problem. The results show that for a given level of accuracy, the explicit update procedure is significantly more efficient than the implicit one. This holds regardless of initial state parameters and input strain increment magnitudes.},

	abstract = {The finite element method is routinely used for the design of offshore wind turbine foundations, with complex time-consuming three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA) typically performed to calibrate site-specific simplified macro element or one-dimensional (1D) finite models for rapid foundation sizing design calculations. The soil constitutive model used in a FEA calculation significantly influences the predicted foundation response. Therefore, given the uptake by industry of FEA for offshore wind turbine foundation design, it is important that practical advanced constitutive models are available which can be demonstrated to work robustly and accurately as design tools.

There have been significant advances in constitutive modelling of soils over the last few decades, with many advanced models presented in the literature. However, the uptake of such advanced models in industry, for foundation design FEA, is still relatively low with more basic robust models typically preferred. The principal reasons for this are considered to be: difficulties in calibrating model parameters to standard laboratory test data; robust implementation of advanced constitutive models in FEA software is time consuming and complex; excessive analysis run times and convergence issues makes the use of some advanced models on design projects unfeasible; and there are few examples that demonstrate the robustness and predictive capabilities of many advanced models for complex 3D soil-structure interaction problems.

It is therefore important that practical constitutive models are also developed which can be demonstrated to work robustly and accurately as useful tools for design FEA. This project therefore considers the development and use of practical constitutive models for design, and includes a review of some existing models, with a focus on the predictive capability and parameter calibration process for foundation design FEA.

A practical robust sand model formulation and implementation is presented for use in design analysis with extensive calibration of the model to laboratory tests data, at a number of different sites, followed by FEA of monopile and suction bucket foundations. In addition, the formulation and implementation of a multi-surface soil plasticity model, termed the PIMS model, which is suitable for short-term storm type loading conditions, is presented. Calibration of the PIMS model to North Sea overconsolidated clay laboratory test data is performed, followed by FEA of monopiles foundations under monotonic and cyclic loading. The suitability of a bounding surface plasticity model for sand to predict the uplift response of a suction bucket foundation under different loading rates is also investigated, with comparison of FEA predictions to previously-published centrifuge test results. Finally, numerical analysis of monopile foundations performed as part of geotechnical design progression for a large offshore wind farm development, in the North Sea is presented using a number of different constitutive models.

In all cases extensive calibration to laboratory element tests (primarily from North Sea soil units) is presented, followed by the comparison of FEA predictions to foundation load tests, where possible, to demonstrate that the models are suitable for design FEA of offshore wind turbine foundations.},

	abstract = {Electricity production from concentrated solar power (CSP) plants has been more commonplace in the last decade since the sun is one of the most abundant, renewable energy sources. The heat transfer fluid temperature in a CSP plant may go up to 1000°C; however, most of the current power plants operate on temperature ranges between 220°C and 565°C due to decomposition of molten salts in high temperatures. Since the sun is not available at nights and cloudy days, an important consideration is how to store the energy received by the sun to use at other times. In this study, a three-dimensional borehole heat exchanger model is developed to store solar energy underground using concrete and molten salt as a storage medium and heat transfer fluid, respectively. While molten salt is circulating through a pipe, which is placed into the concrete, heat is transferred from the molten salt to the concrete or vice versa during the charging and discharging processes. Numerous simulations are conducted using ANSYS Fluent, with varying borehole diameters, mass flow rates, and thermal resistances of the borehole wall. Average concrete temperature, outlet heat transfer fluid temperature, and energy and exergy efficiencies are investigated for each case. It was found here that while concrete temperature increases with increasing mass flow rate, the increasing trend is minimal after the mass flow rate increases beyond 6 kg/s. There exists a negative relation between the borehole diameter and average concrete temperature during the charging process, and vice versa in discharging. Energy and exergy efficiencies varied from 0.2\% to 98.1\% and 0.1\% to 77.9\%, respectively. While the most efficient system was found at a borehole diameter of 550 mm for adiabatic cases, it was found to be 750 mm when heat leakage is taken into consideration. Borehole diameters of 2000 mm performed the worst among all cases due to low heat transfer rates. Heat leakage was found to have a significant impact on energy and exergy efficiencies, especially in energy efficiencies for higher borehole diameters and low mass flow rates in the discharging process.},

However, hydrogen is an electron donor for subsurface microbial processes, which may have important implications for hydrogen recovery, gas injectivity and corrosion. Here, we review the controls on the three major hydrogen consuming processes in the subsurface, methanogenesis, homoacetogenesis, and sulfate reduction, as a basis to estimate the risk for microbial growth in geological hydrogen storage. Evaluating our data on 42 DOGF showed that five of the fields may be considered sterile with respect to hydrogen-consuming microorganisms due to temperatures {\textgreater}122 °C. Only six DOGF can sustain all of the hydrogen consuming processes, due to either temperature, salinity or pressure constraints in the remaining fields. We calculated a potential microbial growth in the order of 1–17*107 cells ml−1 for DOGF with favorable conditions for microbial growth, reached after 0.1–19 days for growing cells and 0.2–6.6 years for resting cells. The associated hydrogen consumption is negligible to small ({\textless}0.01–3.2\% of the stored hydrogen). Our results can help inform decisions about where hydrogen will be stored in the future.},

In this paper, we present a methodology for the experimental characterization and constitutive modeling of the rate-dependent, large-deformation mechanical behavior of isotropic, viscoelastic foam materials under quasi-static and moderate loading rates. We conduct large-deformation, homogeneous simple compression/tension experiments under quasi-static and moderate strain rates for a closed-cell elastomeric foam to inform a phenomenological, isotropic constitutive model. The model is based on a multi-mechanism strategy, consisting of a rate-independent, hyperelastic contribution and several rate-dependent, viscoelastic contributions. This structure is motivated by the rheological concept of a hyperelastic spring in parallel with several nonlinear Maxwell elements. The hyperelastic modeling utilizes the invariants of the logarithmic strain and accounts for high compressibility and strong volumetric-distortional coupling. For the rate-dependent mechanisms, we employ the framework of the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into non-equilibrium elastic and viscous parts. Validation experiments that involve inhomogeneous deformation and deformation-rate fields are conducted, which include spherical indentation, simple-shear-like deformation both without and with a fixed pre-compression, and tension of a specimen with circular holes at different deformation rates. The responses from the validation experiments are compared against model predictions obtained from finite-element-based numerical simulations, demonstrating that the experimental results are accurately captured by the proposed model.},

As the basis for this comparison, we use a dataset from recent microfluidic experiments with precisely controlled pore geometry and wettability conditions, which offers an unprecedented benchmarking opportunity. We compare the results of the 14 participating teams both qualitatively and quantitatively using several standard metrics, such as fractal dimension, finger width, and displacement efficiency. We find that no single method excels across all conditions and that thin films and corner flow present substantial modeling and computational challenges.},

	abstract = {A proppant transport simulator coupled with multi-planar 3D (multi-PL3D) fracture propagation has been developed to examine the proppant distribution among multiple hydraulic fractures during multi-cluster fracturing in a horizontal well. The multi-PL3D fracture model considers wellbore friction, multi-fracture stress interaction, fluid leak-off, and multi-scale propagation regimes. The proppant transport is described by the two-phase (slurry/proppant) flow equations that consider proppant settling, jamming and flow regime transition. A high-resolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) finite difference (FD) scheme is adopted to solve the nonlinear proppant transport equations. An efficient time-stepping scheme is developed to solve the solid/fluid coupling equations and moving boundaries for the multi-PL3D model. The proppant transport model and multi-PL3D model are both validated against previously published results. Using the model, we examine the proppant distributions under different injection schedules, proppant sizes, proppant density, and fluid viscosity. Results show that proppant distribution among multiple fractures is different as the flow rate and fracture width distribution vary due to multi-fracture stress interaction. The proppant in the middle cluster settles remarkably as the flow rate is lowest among the multiple clusters. The proppant is usually jammed at the pinch point, where the fracture width reduces sharply. Proppant adding schedule has a significant effect on the proppant distribution. A constant-concentration results in a proppant stack at the fracture front. In contrast, an increasing concentration favors the prop of the near-wellbore fracture. The proppant distribution area ratio (defined as the proppant distribution area divided by the fracture area) is only 20\% for 20/40 mesh proppant, while the ratio is 45\% for 100 mesh proppant. Slick water can increase the fracture area but not favor promoting the proppant distribution area ratio. The results can be helpful for proppant design for multi-cluster fracturing in a horizontal well.},

Pendant and sessile drop tests show that a surfonic copolymer decreases the interfacial tension γfl and increases the contact angle θ under reservoir conditions. The combined changes in surface tension and contact angle have a pronounced effect on the capillary factor γfl·cosθ. Injection tests using micro-models and pore network simulations show that a smaller capillary factor transforms the displacement pattern and enhances the pore-scale sweep efficiency of CO2, surpassing 40\% in 2-D applications.

A 2-D pore network model scheme is developed to investigate reactive fluid flow in CO2 storage reservoirs during injection when advective transport prevails. Mineral dissolution satisfies kinetic rate laws and continues until thermodynamic equilibrium is reached. In advection-dominant regimes, network simulation results show that species concentration, tube enlargement and flow rate can be summarized in terms of the dimensionless Damköhler number Da which is the ratio between advection time along a pore and the reaction time. Reservoirs will tend to experience localized enlargement near injection wells (before water drying) and compact dissolution in the far-field. The Damköhler number couples with initial pore-size variability to distort the relationship between mean tube diameter and either local or network-average flow rates. Both the Damköhler number and pore-size variability should be considered in field-scale numerical simulators.},

	abstract = {Various energy recovery, storage, conversion and environmental operations may involve repetitive fluid injection and thus, cyclic drainage–imbibition processes. We conducted an experimental study for which polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based micromodels were fabricated with three different levels of pore-space heterogeneity (coefficient of variation, where COV  =  0, 0.25 and 0.5) to represent consolidated and/or partially consolidated sandstones. A total of 10 injection-withdrawal cycles were applied to each micromodel at two different flow rates (0.01 and 0.1 ml min−1). The experimental results were analysed in terms of flow morphology, sweep efficiency, residual saturation, the connection of fluids and the pressure gradient. The pattern of the invasion and displacement of the non-wetting fluid converged more readily in the homogeneous model (COV  =  0) as the repetitive drainage–imbibition process continued. The overall sweep efficiency converged between 0.4 and 0.6 at all tested flow rates, regardless of different flow rates and COV in this study. In contrast, the effective sweep efficiency was observed to increase with higher COV at the lower flow rate, while that trend became reversed at the higher flow rate. Similarly, the residual saturation of the non-wetting fluid was largest at COV  =  0 for the lower flow rate, but it was the opposite for the higher flow-rate case. However, the Minkowski functionals for the boundary length and connectedness of the non-wetting fluid remained quite constant during repetitive fluid flow. Implications of the study results for porous media-compressed air energy storage (PM-CAES) are discussed as a complementary analysis at the end of this paper.Supplementary material: Figures showing the distribution of water (Fig. S1) and oil (Fig. S2) at the end of each drainage and imbibition step in different microfluidic pore-network models are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5276814Thematic collection: This article is part of the Energy Geoscience Series available at: https://www.lyellcollection.org/cc/energy-geoscience-series},

	abstract = {Compressed air energy storage (CAES) technology has been re-emerging as a viable energy storage option to address challenges coming from the mismatch between renewable energy sources and energy demands. Various geologic formations, such as hard rock caverns, depleted oil/gas reservoirs, and saline aquifers, have been considered as the alternative of salt dome caverns for CAES. Storing compressed air in either depleted oil/gas reservoirs or saline aquifers involves two-phase fluid flow in porous media. Moreover, the drainage-imbibition process is likely to be repeated numerous cycles during the CAES operation. In this regard, a thorough understanding of the two-phase fluid flow during the cyclic injection and withdrawal of compressed air is critical to predict the performance of CAES in porous media and to improve its efficiency. This study investigates the repetitive two-phase fluid (water/oil) flow using polydimethylsiloxane-based pore-network micromodels. Two different geometries, Type I with circular solids and Type II with square solids were prepared to represent an unconsolidated and/or partially consolidated sandstone and a fracture network of carbonate rock. During repetitive drainage-imbibition cycles, it was observed that the occupation efficiency of the non-wetting fluid (water) converged to a narrow range for Type I model, while it showed a pronounced fluctuation for Type II, which was partly due to the low residual saturation of the non-wetting fluid during the imbibition process. Besides, the prevalent displacement modes of wetting and non-wetting fluids at the pore-scale were noticeably different between the two pore structures, which were manifested in the unpredictable pattern of non-wetting fluid flow for Type II over the extended cycles. Sweep efficiency and residual saturation in Type I were greater than those in Type II; however, an analysis of effective sweep efficiency and effective residual saturation yielded an opposite result. It implies that the actual efficiency of non-wetting fluid invasion is higher in Type II, and the Type II geometry can accommodate more non-wetting fluid in a given reservoir volume during the charge period. Moreover, more non-wetting fluid can be discharged back for energy regeneration. In conclusion, the geometry of porous media has a great influence on the efficiency of repetitive drainage-imbibition cycles of two-phase fluid flow in porous media, and thus more elaborate study is needed to gain the confidence on the cyclic efficiency of CAES in porous media.},

However, CO2 injection into subsurface can induce reservoir expansion and fault reactivation, which ultimately result in near-surface infrastructure damage and personnel insecurity. Distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS) technologies function one single fiber as an array of sensors to in-situ monitor multi-parameters, such as geomechanical deformation (i.e., strain), temperature, acoustics and pressure along the entire fiber or cable length. Due to its superiority over conventional geophone and detector, DFOS tool possesses great potential to sense geofluid injection-induced small disturbances in deep subsurface. Here we begin by highlighting recent research efforts in available monitoring tools employed in GCS sites. Given the increasing attentions of optical sensing, we present a first-hand review of DFOS categories, sensing principles, and advantages for GCS related investigations from both laboratory and field scales. We discuss in detail three typical DFOS-deployed GCS projects and explore the implicit findings to guide subsequent GCS field applications. Finally, we summarize the major challenges and going forward in developing, utilizing, and extending DFOS systems to widely apply for the future large-scale all-optical GCS monitoring sites.},

	abstract = {A continuous active source seismic monitoring data set was collected with crosswell geometry during CO2 injection at the Frio-II brine pilot, near Liberty, TX. Previous studies have shown that spatiotemporal changes in the P wave first arrival time reveal the movement of the injected CO2 plume in the storage zone. To further constrain the CO2 saturation, particularly at higher saturation levels, we investigate spatial-temporal changes in the seismic attenuation of the first arrivals. The attenuation changes over the injection period are estimated by the amount of the centroid frequency shift computed by local time-frequency analysis. We observe that (1) at receivers above the injection zone seismic attenuation does not change in a physical trend; (2) at receivers in the injection zone attenuation sharply increases following injection and peaks at specific points varying with distributed receivers, which is consistent with observations from time delays of first arrivals; then, (3) attenuation decreases over the injection time. The attenuation change exhibits a bell-shaped pattern during CO2 injection. Under Frio-II field reservoir conditions, White's patchy saturation model can quantitatively explain both the P wave velocity and attenuation response observed. We have combined the velocity and attenuation change data in a crossplot format that is useful for model-data comparison and determining patch size. Our analysis suggests that spatial-temporal attenuation change is not only an indicator of the movement and saturation of CO2 plumes, even at large saturations, but also can quantitatively constrain CO2 plume saturation when used jointly with seismic velocity.},

A preliminary laboratory experiment is implemented to testify to the sensing effectiveness of this proposed hybrid DFOS system. Laboratory experiments indicate that the measured strain via SMF along the heterogeneous Tako sandstone core surface coincides well with conventional strain gauges and better tracks injected CO2 fronts. Moreover, this novel DFOS-based optical fiber cable has been deployed behind the well casing for detecting impacted zones along the well depth direction in an actual 300 m-deep field well. Field testing shows that the extent of the deformed zone induced by injected CO2 is successfully monitored and quantified in terms of measured in situ strain profiles.

Issues of preferential flow (critical to the success of in situ techniques) and how to control it with engineering measures are discussed in detail. It is clear that in situ recovery of metals from anthropogenic ores is a novel technology area that links new sustainable remediation approaches for contaminated materials and technospheric mining for closing material loops, and warrants the further research and development of technologies applicable to major waste streams.},

	abstract = {Because over 60\% of the total energy consumed in conventional mining consists of excavating, hauling, and liberating processes, the energy consumption in conventional methods of mining has increased exponentially with the decline in global ore-grades. In-situ leaching (ISL) is an alternative mining technology, which eliminates these processes. However, ISL is currently limited to porous rock. Expansion of ISL to impervious mineral bearing rocks requires controlled, artificial fracture stimulation and the current practice of hydraulic fracturing is not compatible due to the associated environmental impacts and uncontrolled fracture propagation. Therefore, to extend the application of ISL to impervious rocks, an alternative fracturing method using Soundless Cracking Demolition Agents (SCDAs), which is capable of producing controlled fractures in a rock mass, is proposed in this study. With the aim of understanding the fracturing performance of SCDA under in-situ stress conditions prevalent in ISL environments, a 3D numerical model for SCDA charging was produced using Particle Flow Code (PFC3D 5.0) and validated with experimentally obtained data. The model was then extended to investigate the fracture mechanism of SCDA charging at various confining pressures of 5, 10, 15, and 20 MPa. Simulation results suggest that during SCDA charging, the number of radial fracture propagations and the total fracture damage in the rock mass increase with the confinement and the fracture pattern is dependent on the confining stress of the surrounding rock. In comparison to a hydraulically fractured specimen with identical dimensions, the fracture density of SCDA charged specimen showed a ten-fold increase at high confining pressures (20 MPa). Furthermore, as opposed to an uncontrolled, unidirectional diametrical fracture generated by hydraulic fracturing, SCDA charging produces multiple radial fractures around the injection well facilitating better spatial distribution of fluid flow for ISL. The results of this study imply that SCDA charging produces a denser and a controllable fracture network compared to hydraulic fracturing, which could potentially expand ISL applications to impervious rocks.},

A detailed study of mineral alteration in ISL will help us to better understand pore-plugging mechanism and enlighten us to develop the corresponding de-plugging method. The Wuyier uranium deposit in Yili Basin, Xinjiang Province, NW China, has been acid in situ leached (ISL) for more than 20 years; thus, it provides an excellent example for the study of mineralogical alteration during acid ISL. In this study, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) have been used to study sandstone samples collected from ore-bearing aquifer of Wuyier Deposit. Results show that during acid ISL, quartz is less influenced while feldspar could be altered to kaolinite and quartz. According to the occurrence of minerals in sandstone pores, two types of sandstone pore-plugging are observed by SEM. The physical pore plugging is caused by accumulation of micro-authigenic quartz and clay particles derived from alteration of feldspar, while the precipitations of CaSO4, Al(OH)3, Fe(OH)3, and SiO2(aq) filling the pores of sandstones or covering the surface of rock grains lead to the chemical pore-plugging of ores.},

	abstract = {This article presents the results of groundwater monitoring over a period of six years and the interpretation of these results by a reactive transport model, following an In Situ Recovery (ISR) test on the Dulaan Uul uranium deposit in Mongolia. An environmental monitoring survey was set up using 17 piezometers, from which it has been possible to describe the changes in the water composition before, during and after the ISR test. The water quality before the start of mining activities rendered it unfit for human consumption. During and after the test, a descent of the saline plume was observed, resulting in a dilution of the injection solutions. After a rapid decrease to pH = 1.13 during the production phase of the ISR test, the pH stabilized at around 4 in the production area and 5.5 below the production cell one year after the end of the test. Uranium and radium were being naturally attenuated. Uranium returned to background concentrations (0.3 mg/L) after two years and the measured 226Ra concentrations represent no more than 10\% of the expected concentrations during production (75 Bq/L). The modeling of the contaminants of concern mobility, namely pH and concentrations of sulfate, uranium and 226Ra, is based on several key complementary mechanisms: density flow, cation exchange with clay minerals and co-precipitation of 226Ra in the barite. The modeling results show that the observed plume descent and sulfate dilution can only be predicted if consideration of a high-density flow is included. Similarly, the changes in pH and 226Ra concentration are only correctly predicted when the cationic exchanges with the clays and the co-precipitation reaction within the barite using the solid solution theory are integrated into the models. Finally, the proper representation of the changes in water composition at the scale of the test requires the use of a sufficiently fine mesh (1 m × 1 m cell) to take into account the spatial variability of hydrogeological (permeability distribution in particular) and geological (reduced, oxidized and mineralized facies distributions) parameters.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the history and application of in situ recovery (ISR) to a wide variety of metals. The increasing application of ISR may provide an important method to address a key issue for the mining industry, namely the cost of production. ISR transfers a significant proportion of hydrometallurgical processing to mineralised bodies in the subsurface to directly obtain solutions of metals of interest. As a result, there is little surface disturbance and no tailings or waste rock are generated at ISR mines. However, for ISR to be successful, deposits need to be permeable (either naturally or artificially induced), and the metals of interest readily amenable to dissolution by leaching solutions in a reasonable period of time, with an acceptable consumption of leaching reagents. The paper discusses the following aspects of ISR:•History. ISR for uranium was introduced in 1959 in the USA, and subsequently applied in many countries over last 50years, particularly in the USSR. The share of uranium mined by ISR reached 51\% of world production in 2014, and the capacity of ISR mining of uranium is now comparable with that from conventional uranium mines.•Commodities. A review of the use of ISR for mining other commodities, namely copper, gold, nickel, scandium, rhenium, rare earth elements, yttrium, selenium, molybdenum, and vanadium. ISR for copper was introduced in the 1970s and there were several successful natural tests and mines. Scandium, rhenium, rare earth elements, yttrium, selenium, molybdenum, and vanadium were mined in pilot tests as by-products of uranium extraction. ISR of gold, copper, nickel, rare earth elements and scandium has been successfully developed over recent years. The paper discusses other commodities that have potential to be mined using ISR.•Applicability of ISR is addressed by a discussion of the features of mineralisation that need to be considered during different stages of ISR projects. Permeability,11More accurately is hydraulic conductivity or permeability coefficient, m/day. hydrogeological conditions and selective leachability are the most critical parameters for ISR, and must be defined in the evaluation and exploration stages. Morphology and depth of mineralisation, thicknesses and grades, distribution of mineralisation, presence of aquicludes, and environmental conditions are also important factors for ISR projects.•Environmental issues. ISR allows the extraction of mineralisation with minimal disturbance to existing natural conditions. In contrast to underground and open pit mining, there are smaller volumes of mining and hydrometallurgical effluents that require management. Clearly contamination of groundwater by ISR reagents is the critical aspect requiring management during an ISR operation. Control of leaching in ISR operations and various ways of cleaning aquifers are discussed in the paper.•Economics. ISR operations deliver a range of benefits including lower CapEx costs for mine development, processing plant and infrastructure. ISR enables production to start at low capital cost and then a modular increase in production, as well as very flexible production capacity. The costs of ISR for different commodities (copper, gold, nickel, scandium, rhenium, rare earth elements, yttrium, selenium, molybdenum, vanadium) are discussed, with economic parameters for uranium production from ISR and conventional provided for comparison. The CapEx, OpEx and common cut-off grades for ISR for different commodities are discussed.•Exploration, resource estimation and the development of ISR projects require a number of different approaches compared to conventional mining projects. These criteria and the necessary methodology for resource estimation for ISR projects are described in the article.},

However, existing approaches for coal exploitation and utilization are highly detrimental to the geological formations from which they are extracted and the atmospheric environment. Moreover, underground mining can induce earthquakes that lead to fatalities and financial losses. The demand to abandon coal mining is increasing worldwide, and the need for efficient, safe, and environmentally acceptable coal exploitation and utilization has garnered widespread attention. We propose a novel unmanned automatic machine-based mining and in situ conversion method for the safe and clean exploitation and utilization of subsurface coal resources. Solid coal is transformed in situ into fluidized energy resources using this method. To evaluate its effectiveness, a geological model of a coal mine was generated, and a numerical simulation based on the continuum-based discrete element method was conducted to compare the mining-induced stress distribution, roof subsidence, coal wall failure, and microseismicity for fluidized and traditional mining methods. Our results indicate that the proposed mining method can significantly reduce damage to the geological formation and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the exploitation and utilization of coal resources. We also discuss the limitations of the current study and future research possibilities.},

	abstract = {Storing carbon dioxide in the subsurface as carbonate minerals has the benefit of long-term stability and immobility. Ultramafic rock formations have been suggested as a potential reservoir for this type of storage due to the availability of cations to react with dissolved carbon dioxide and the fast reaction rates associated with minerals common in ultramafic formations; however, the rapid reactions have the potential to couple with the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of the rocks and little is known about the extent and mechanisms of this coupling. In this study, we argue that the dissolution of primary minerals and the precipitation of secondary minerals along pre-existing fractures in samples lead to reductions in both the apparent Young's modulus and shear strength of aggregates, accompanied by reduction in permeability. Hydrostatic and triaxial deformation experiments were run on dunite samples saturated with de-ionized water and carbon dioxide-rich solutions while stress, strain, permeability and pore fluid chemistry were monitored. Sample microstructures were examined after reaction and deformation using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that channelized dissolution and carbonate mineral precipitation in the samples saturated with carbon dioxide-rich solutions modify the structure of grain boundaries, leading to the observed reductions in stiffness, strength and permeability. A geochemical model was run to help interpret fluid chemical data, and we find that the apparent reaction rates in our experiments are faster than rates calculated from powder reactors, suggesting mechanically enhanced reaction rates. In conclusion, we find that chemo-mechanical coupling during carbon mineralization in dunites leads to substantial modification of mechanical and hydraulic behavior that needs to be accounted for in future modeling efforts of in situ carbon mineralization projects.},

The frequency of the pulsations can be larger than 1 Hz; sometimes vibrations in the audible range ({\textgreater} 20 Hz [14.2, 14.3]) occur where the amplitudes are low [14.4]. The latter is called silo noise, silo honking or silo music: The noise often appears intermittently with a sound similar to that of a truck horn. Distinct shocks appearing at irregular intervals of seconds to hours can also occur, which are called silo quaking or silo thumps. Depending on the properties of the ground supporting the silo, shocks can spread out far into the surroundings. Thus, silo quaking and silo honking can affect the environment (Fig. 14.1), are unpleasant for personnel nearby and can damage a silo structure.},

To better understand the mechanisms forming such structures, the impacts of the viscoelastic deformation and strongly nonlinear porosity-dependent permeability of clay-rich materials are assessed from an experimental and numerical modeling perspective. The experimental methods to measure the poroviscoelastic and transport properties of intact and remolded shale have been developed, and the experimental data is used to constrain the numerical simulations. It is demonstrated that viscoelastic deformation combined with nonlinear porosity-dependent permeability triggers the development of localized flow channels, often imaged as seismic chimneys. The permeability inside a channel increases by several orders of magnitude compared to the background values. In addition, the propagation time scale and the channel size strongly depend on the material properties of the fluid and the rock. The time-dependent behavior of the clay-rich rock may play a key role in the long-term integrity of the subsurface formations.},

Experience from laboratory triaxial compression tests and from subsurface operations indicates that shear and volumetric deformations are interdependent. Their mutual dependence results in shear-enhanced compaction and shear-induced dilation under short-term and long-term loading. Using a classical averaging approach, we consider the evolution of a single fluid-filled pore in a solid elastoplastic or viscoplastic matrix under combined pressure and shear loading to introduce a new failure envelope and 3-D constitutive relations for both rate-dependent and rate-independent deformation of porous rocks. Our model provides a simple description of rock behavior under a wide range of strain rates. The model predictions agree well with experimental data from triaxial instantaneous and creep tests. Analytical and numerical solutions for solitary porosity wave propagation in viscoplastic rocks in the presence of shear were obtained. New solutions show that new rheological laws have serious implications for porosity waves. Plasticity onset leads to compaction-decompaction asymmetry and the formation of elongated channel-like porosity waves. Shear-induced dilation facilitates porosity wave propagation at fluid pressures below the lithostatic stress. This makes porosity waves a viable mechanism in the formation of focused fluid flow structures in crustal rocks.},

	abstract = {Large amounts of CO2 have to be captured, transported, injected and safely stored in the subsurface in order to counteract increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to steadily high consumption of energy from fossil fuels. The injection of gigatons of carbon dioxide poses challenges for pressure management and the mechanical integrity of the storage complex. Optimizing the injection strategy, controlling deformation, preventing leakage and assuring safe long term containment requires reliable and predictive hydromechanical modelling. Based on a newly derived thermodynamically consistent set of equations we have developed fully coupled codes in one, two and three dimensions. In accordance with field observations and laboratory measurements, stress dependent poro- viscoelastoplastic deformation is taken into account. Our simulations predict the spontaneous formation of self- localizing high-porosity channels (or pathway flow) under conditions applicable to CO2 storage in reservoirs. These channels form due to mechanical instabilities that occur as a natural outcome of buoyancy driven flow in viscoplastically deforming rocks. Our results indicate that viscous deformation may explain the formation of chimneys such as those observed at the Sleipner pilot, and that non-linear effects have a major impact on the velocity and distribution of the fluid as well as on stress and deformation of the rock matrix. Thus, complex rheology and non-linear coupling between porosity, permeability, pressures and stresses should be included in state of the art reservoir simulation software in order to determine safe injection and storage conditions and correctly model observations and monitoring results.},

	abstract = {Fingering, veining, channelling and focussing of porous fluids are widely observed phenomena in the Earth’s interior, driving a range of geo-processes across all scales. While observations suggest fairly localized flow patterns induced by fractures, the classical Darcian model predicts diffusive behaviour that leads to never-ending spreading and delocalization. We here investigate an alternative physical mechanism without the need to involve fractures. Decompaction weakening leads to the formation and propagation of localized flow-pathways in fluid-saturated porous media. We numerically solve the coupled equations using high-resolution 2-D and 3-D numerical modelling to predict non-linear porous flow in a non-linearly viscously deforming matrix. We show that high-porosity channels may be a dynamic and natural outcome of sufficiently resolved hydromechanical coupling and decompaction weakening. We propose an efficient solution strategy that involves an iterative pseudo-transient numerical method to solve the coupled system of equations in a matrix-free fashion. We discuss benefits and limitations of this approach that performs optimally on hardware accelerators such as graphical processing units and is well-suited for supercomputing. We benchmark the pseudo-transient routines against commonly used direct-iterative solving strategies and show convergence towards identical results. Furthermore, we use the fast solver to systematically study in 2-D the high-porosity channel propagation velocity as a function of bulk and shear viscosity ratios and report discrepancy between 2-D and 3-D configurations. We conclude that the fluid-flow rate in the channels is up to three orders of magnitude higher than expected by pure Darcian flow regimes and show that the high-porosity channels occurrence remains with strain rate dependant shear viscosity. We provide both the 2-D MATLAB-based direct-iterative and pseudo-transient routines for full reproducibility of the presented results and suggest our model configuration as a key benchmark case to validate the implementation of hydromechanical coupling in 2-D and 3-D numerical codes. The routines are available from Bitbucket and the Swiss Geocomputing Centre website, and are also supporting information to this paper.},

In the hydrodynamic limit, the DBM recovers the modified Navier-Stokes equations for reacting species in a force field. Compared to standard lattice Boltzmann models, the DBM presents not only more accurate hydrodynamic quantities, but also detailed nonequilibrium effects that are essential yet long-neglected by traditional fluid dynamics. Apart from nonequilibrium terms (viscous stress and heat flux) in conventional models, specific hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonequilibrium quantities (high order kinetic moments and their departure from equilibrium) are dynamically obtained from the DBM in a straightforward way.

	abstract = {Injection of CO2 subsurface may lead to chemical reactivity of rock where CO2 is dissolved in groundwater. This process can modify pore networks to increase or decrease porosity through mineral dissolution and precipitation. A lattice Boltzmann (LB) based computational model study on the pore scale reactive transport in three dimensional heterogeneous porous media (sandstone consisting of both reactive and non-reactive minerals) is described. This study examines how fluid transport in porous materials subject to reactive conditions is affected by unsteady state local reactions and unstable dissolution fronts. The reaction of a calcite cemented core sub-plug from the Hutton Sandstone of the Surat Basin, Australia, is used as a study case. In particular, the work studies the interaction of acidic fluid (an aqueous solution with an elevated concentration of carbonic acid) with reactive (e.g. calcite) and assumed non-reactive (e.g. quartz) mineral surfaces, mineral dissolution and mass transfer, and resultant porosity change. The proposed model is implemented in our custom LBM code and suitable for studies of multiple mineral reactions with disparate reaction rates. A model for carbonic acid reaction with calcite cemented sandstone in the CO2-water-rock system is verified through laboratory experimental data including micro-CT characterization before and after core reaction at reservoir conditions. The experimentally validated model shows: (1) the dissolution of calcite cement forms conductive channels at the pore scale, and enables the generation of pore throats and connectivity; (2) the model is able to simulate the reaction process until the reaction equilibrium status is achieved (around 1440 days); (3) calcite constituting a volume of around 9.6\% of the whole core volume is dissolved and porosity is consequently increased from 1.1\% to 10.7\% on reaching equilibrium; (4) more than a third of the calcite (constituting 7.4\% of the total core volume) is unaffected, which suggests that this calcite is not connected with open pores (at the resolution of the model) that the acidic fluid can access. The model enables exploration of the porosity change in systems as they react, which has applications for analysis of the induced permeability change at the macroscale.},

Besides, the dissolved solid mass is calculated by Volume of Pixel method. The effects of pressure difference, wettability, oil interfacial tension and porous media porosity on the dissolution reaction are investigated numerically, and the results show that: the increasing pressure difference, oil interfacial tension and porosity promotes the dissolution reaction. The influence of wettability on dissolution and acid breakthrough rates depend on the phase distribution of non-acidic fluids. In addition, the dissolution dead zone may appear when the inlet flow rate or solid particle size is small. Increasing the interfacial tension of the oil facilitates its separation from the porous medium.},

The permeability–porosity relationship for the more geometrically complex porous medium shows much more complexity than that for the simple fractured medium. While a very small Da sets an upper bound for the permeability–porosity relationship for the simple medium, a combination of a high Da and Pe results in wormholing, and the fastest permeability increase for the complex medium. At a moderate Pe but large Da, a transition from transport-limited dissolution regime to wormholing is also observed for the complex medium.},

From April 2015 to February 2016, approximately 36 kilotonnes of CO2 were injected into the reservoir at a depth of 3130–3350 m. We have developed an analysis of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) 3D vertical seismic profiling data acquired in February 2016, marking the first seismic survey since injection began. The VSP data were processed in parallel with baseline preinjection data from a November 2013 survey, with the objective of detecting and characterizing the subsurface CO2 plume and evaluating the repeatability of DAS in a reservoir monitoring project. A single processing sequence was devised that (1) accurately imaged the reservoir for the baseline and monitor data and (2) attained adequate repeatability to observe time-lapse differences related to the presence of CO2. Repeatability was somewhat compromised by the less advanced noise cancellation methodology of the DAS system used for the baseline survey. In the final cross-equalized migrated data volumes, normalized root-mean-square (nrms) difference values of \&lt;0.4 were attained at the reservoir level indicating good repeatability compared with most surface seismic studies. An injection-related amplitude anomaly with maximum nrms values of approximately 0.7 is apparent in the Deadwood Formation of the reservoir, whereas no significant nrms anomalies were observed near the injection and monitoring wells in the Black Island Member or above the reservoir.},

Multiple tests in adverse well conditions let us understand the impact of source size and other factors on the spatially dependent quality of time-lapse DAS data and prove that excellent image repeatability is achievable under typical field conditions. Frequent repeat surveys allowed us to predict the timing of water arrival in a producer and to observe new water injection patterns that are important for understanding water-flood performance.

The system is composed of five deviated ∼1600 m deep wells equipped with distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) acting as seismic receivers and nine seismic orbital vibrators (SOV) as seismic sources. DAS recording is performed continuously by three iDASv3 units. Each SOV operates for 2.5 h at a time, and hence all SOVs operating sequentially (during daytime only) produce in a single vintage every two days. Each vintage consists of 45 offset VSP transects covering predicted CO2 plume migration paths over ∼0.7 km2 area. An automated data processing implemented on-site reduces data size from ∼1.3 TB/day to ∼500 MB/day with the results transmitted to the office daily. The repeatability analysis based on pre-injection data (acquired from May to October 2020 before the injection start in December 2020) shows that variability of SOV performance is the main source of non-repeatability while borehole measurements are stable. An SOV waveform could reach NRMS value from 20 to 100 \% within a few days. However, deconvolution of the seismograms with the waveform of the direct wave reduces the repeatability to within 10–15 \% NRMS.},

In this study, an evaluation is made of baseline DAS and traditional geophone VSP data from an observation well located 150m away from the injection well. Comparative images are analyzed for quantities of injected CO2, ranging from 27kt to 330kt to determine the visibility of the CO2 plume over time. The study demonstrated that DAS VSP is a feasible technique for reservoir monitoring at the Aquistore site. The CO2 plume should be visible near the borehole after 90days (27kt of CO2) of injection, with increasing clarity over a three-year duration.},

	abstract = {In situ leaching offers a potentially attractive way to extract copper from the subsurface without costly fragmentation and processing. Applicability of in situ leaching is limited to deposits where sufficient permeability exists and where the copper and gangue mineralogy is amenable to leaching. A key challenge from past projects is establishing uniform contact between the fluid and the formation in fractured environments, particularly if fractures become blocked by gypsum and jarosite precipitation during leaching. Previous projects have demonstrated that in situ leaching of copper sulfides is feasible by regenerating ferric iron using atmospheric bacteria cultures, pressurized oxygen gas, or chemical oxidants. Oilfield technologies, including polymer injection for permeability modification and nanoparticle tracers, may have future applications for diagnosing and mitigating short circuiting between wells. Geophysical techniques such as electrical resistance tomography have the potential to provide real-time data on lixiviant movement in the subsurface, thus aiding in both recovery optimization and environmental control. In this review, data from past copper in situ leaching projects are assembled, with a focus on recovery without prior permeability enhancement. The resulting database includes key operating variables from copper in situ leaching projects ranging from field scale pilots to commercial operations.},

	abstract = {In-situ leaching (ISL) is a chemical method for recovering useful minerals and metals directly from underground ore bodies which is also referred to as ‘solution mining’. ISL is commonly used for uranium mining, accounting for about 45\% of global production. The main benefits are claimed to be a lower environmental impact in terms of visual disturbances, emissions, lower energy use, cost compared with conventional open-cut or underground mining methods, and potential utilisation of lower grade resources. However, there is a lack of reported studies on the assessment of the environmental impacts of ISL, particularly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The SimaPro LCA software was used to estimate the GHG footprint of the ISL of uranium, gold and copper. The total GHG emissions were estimated to be 38.0 kg CO2-e/kg U3O8 concentrate (yellowcake), 29 t CO2-e/kg gold, and 4.78 kg CO2-e/kg Cu. The GHG footprint of ISL uranium was significantly lower than that of conventional mining, however, the footprints of copper and gold were not much less compared with conventional mining methods. This is due to the lower ore grade of ISL deposits and recovery compared with high ore grades and recovery of conventional technology. Additionally, the use of large amount of electricity for pumping in case of ISL contributes to this result. The electricity consumed in pumping leaching solutions was by far the greatest contributor to the well-field related activities associated with ISL of uranium, gold and copper. The main strategy to reduce the GHG footprint of ISL mining should be to use electricity derived from low emission sources. In particular, renewable sources such as solar would be suitable for ISL as these operations are typically in remote locations with smaller deposits compared with conventional mining sites.},

	abstract = {Conventional gold mining operations are facing significant challenges due to declining ore grades and increasingly higher strip ratios. To meet global demands while limiting associated environmental impacts, alternative techniques to extract resources, including gold, are urgently needed. We suggest that in situ leaching coupled with electrokinetics (EK-ISL) could potentially enable recovery of gold from (subeconomic) ores with a significantly smaller environmental footprint than current mining techniques. EK-ISL would involve the leaching of gold, in situ, using a lixiviant that is introduced via a set of wells. A voltage gradient is applied to transport the lixiviant through the orebody. The gold is leached and also transported towards a set of recovery wells. At the surface the gold is recovered and the lixiviant can be recycled. This study was designed to verify the in-principle feasibility of this novel technique. A series of laboratory experiments was performed with an iodide/tri-iodide solution as lixiviant to extract gold from unconsolidated porous media. Experiments in which pyrite was included as proxy gangue mineral and complimentary bottle roll tests showed a declining efficiency of EK-ISL gold leaching with increasing pyrite oxidation. However, 80\% gold recovery was still achieved, even with the highest tested pyrite concentration (5.26wt\%). The coupled transport and reaction processes were interpreted and quantified through numerical model simulations that were constrained by the experimental observations. Overall the experimental and numerical modeling results suggest the in-principle feasibility of EK-ISL.},

	abstract = {A modular borehole monitoring concept has been implemented to provide a suite of well-based monitoring tools that can be deployed cost effectively in a flexible and robust package. The initial modular borehole monitoring system was deployed as part of a CO2 injection test operated by the Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership near Citronelle, Alabama. The Citronelle modular monitoring system transmits electrical power and signals, fibre-optic light pulses, and fluids between the surface and a reservoir. Additionally, a separate multi-conductor tubing-encapsulated line was used for borehole geophones, including a specialized clamp for casing clamping with tubing deployment. The deployment of geophones and fibre-optic cables allowed comparison testing of distributed acoustic sensing. We designed a large source effort ({\textgreater}64 sweeps per source point) to test fibre-optic vertical seismic profile and acquired data in 2013. The native measurement in the specific distributed acoustic sensing unit used (an iDAS from Silixa Ltd) is described as a localized strain rate. Following a processing flow of adaptive noise reduction and rebalancing the signal to dimensionless strain, improvement from repeated stacking of the source was observed. Conversion of the rebalanced strain signal to equivalent velocity units, via a scaling by local apparent velocity, allows quantitative comparison of distributed acoustic sensing and geophone data in units of velocity. We see a very good match of uncorrelated time series in both amplitude and phase, demonstrating that velocity-converted distributed acoustic sensing data can be analyzed equivalent to vertical geophones. We show that distributed acoustic sensing data, when averaged over an interval comparable to typical geophone spacing, can obtain signal-to-noise ratios of 18 dB to 24 dB below clamped geophones, a result that is variable with noise spectral amplitude because the noise characteristics are not identical. With vertical seismic profile processing, we demonstrate the effectiveness of downgoing deconvolution from the large spatial sampling of distributed acoustic sensing data, along with improved upgoing reflection quality. We conclude that the extra source effort currently needed for tubing-deployed distributed acoustic sensing vertical seismic profile, as part of a modular monitoring system, is well compensated by the extra spatial sampling and lower deployment cost as compared with conventional borehole geophones.},

	abstract = {Mining industries worldwide have inevitably resorted to exploiting resources from the deep underground. However, traditional mining methods can cause various problems, e.g., considerable mining difficulty, environmental degradations, and frequent disastrous accidents. To exploit deep resources in the future, the concept of mining must be reconsidered and innovative new theories, methods, and technologies must be applied. To effectively acquire coal resources deeper than 2000 m, new theoretical and technological concepts about deep in situ fluidized mining are required. The limits of mining depth need to be broken to acquire deep-coal resources in an environmentally friendly, safe, and efficient manner. This is characterized by ‘There are no coal on the ground and no men in the coal mine’. First, this paper systematically explains deep in situ fluidized coal mining. Then, it presents a new theoretical concept, including the theories of mining-induced rock mechanics, three-field visualization, multi-physics coupling for in situ transformation, and in situ mining, transformation and transport. It also presents key technological concepts, including those of intelligent, unmanned, and fluidized mining. Finally, this paper presents a strategic roadmap for deep in situ fluidized coal mining. In summary, this paper develops new theoretical and technological systems for accomplishing groundbreaking innovations in mining technologies of coal resources in the deep underground.},

The extreme complexity in recovery conditions, including ultra-low-permeability reservoirs, low-energy-density reserves and high temperatures and high pressures, deﬁnes a challenge in efﬁciently recovering such energy, fuel and mineral resources. Hence, development of efﬁcient mining methods and the related determination of geo-mechanical properties of reservoirs remains a key topical issue. During the simultaneous 2nd International Symposium on In-situ modiﬁcation of Deposit Properties for Improving Mining and the 7th Unconventional Geomechanics Symposium, held both in person and online from November 7-8, 2020, a broad array of advances in the science and technology of geo-energy and geo-resource recovery were presented. The symposia were attended by more than 200 participants from China, USA, Canada, UK, Australia, Japan, Singapore, and Turkey. Twenty-four invited talks were presented, seven of which were online, four of which were pre-recorded, and thirteen of which were in person. Twenty-two general talks were held in two parallel sessions. Participants interact freely through both online and in-person speakers. These interactions will enable future collaborations.},

	abstract = {A green copper stained outcrop on the south slope of Red Hill attracted the attention of prospectors at the time of the discovery of the nearby Mammoth mine in July 1879. Some of the oldest test pits excavated at this site probably date from the early 1880s. However, prospecting efforts over the next four decades failed to locate any ore grade mineralization and the claims were allowed to lapse. In July 1925, the original San Manuel Claims No. 1 to No. 5 (inclusive) were staked at Red Hill by Anselmo Laguna. James Douglas, a saloon owner in Superior, purchased a third interest in the San Manuel claim group in June 1926 and subsequently acquired another third interest in August 1939. The remaining third interest in the claim group was acquired by James Douglas and Burns Giffin in October 1939. They deeded a quarter interest in the property to Victor Erickson in March 1940 in return for performing assessment work on their claims and building a small camp at Red Hill. By the summer of 1942, they realized they needed assistance from someone, who had mining experience. In August 1942, they enlisted the support of Henry Nichols, an assayer at Magma Copper, who agreed to assist them in return for an interest in the property. Over the years, the number of claims had also been expanded from five to twenty-one. Discovery and Development (1942-1956)},

	abstract = {A new equation of state for the thermodynamic properties of natural gases, similar gases, and other mixtures, the GERG-2008 equation of state, is presented in this work. This equation is an expanded version of the GERG-2004 equation. GERG-2008 is explicit in the Helmholtz free energy as a function of density, temperature, and composition. The equation is based on 21 natural gas components: methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, ethane, propane, n-butane, isobutane, n-pentane, isopentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, water, hydrogen sulfide, helium, and argon. Over the entire composition range, GERG-2008 covers the gas phase, liquid phase, supercritical region, and vapor–liquid equilibrium states for mixtures of these components. The normal range of validity of GERG-2008 includes temperatures from (90 to 450) K and pressures up to 35 MPa where the most accurate experimental data of the thermal and caloric properties are represented to within their accuracy. The extended validity range reaches from (60 to 700) K and up to 70 MPa. The given numerical information (including all of the sophisticated derivatives) enables the use of GERG-2008 for all of the various technical applications. Examples are processing, transportation through pipelines or by shipping, storage and liquefaction of natural gas, and processes to separate gas components. Comparisons with other equations of state, for example, AGA8-DC92 and Peng–Robinson equation (P-R), are also presented. GERG-2008 will be adopted as an ISO Standard (ISO 20765-2/3) for natural gases.},

	abstract = {This chapter gives the reader an introduction into the microbiology of deep geological systems with a special focus on potential geobiotechnological applications and respective risk assessments. It has been known for decades that microbial activity is responsible for the degradation or conversion of hydrocarbons in oil, gas, and coal reservoirs. These processes occur in the absence of oxygen, a typical characteristic of such deep ecosystems. The understanding of the responsible microbial processes and their environmental regulation is not only of great scientific interest. It also has substantial economic and social relevance, inasmuch as these processes directly or indirectly affect the quantity and quality of the stored oil or gas. As outlined in the following chapter, in addition to the conventional hydrocarbons, new interest in such deep subsurface systems is rising for different technological developments. These are introduced together with related geomicrobiological topics. The capture and long-term storage of large amounts of carbon dioxide, carbon capture and storage (CCS), for example, in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, is considered to be an important option to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. On the other hand, the increasing contribution of energy from natural and renewable sources, such as wind, solar, geothermal energy, or biogas production leads to an increasing interest in underground storage of renewable energies. Energy carriers, that is, biogas, methane, or hydrogen, are often produced in a nonconstant manner and renewable energy may be produced at some distance from the place where it is needed. Therefore, storing the energy after its conversion to methane or hydrogen in porous reservoirs or salt caverns is extensively discussed. All these developments create new research fields and challenges for microbiologists and geobiotechnologists. As a basis for respective future work, we introduce the three major topics, that is, CCS, underground storage of gases from renewable energy production, and the production of geothermal energy, and summarize the current state of knowledge about related geomicrobiological and geobiotechnological aspects in this chapter. Finally, recommendations are made for future research.},

	abstract = {Viruses are the most abundant biological entity on Earth and their interactions with microbial communities are recognized to influence microbial ecology and impact biogeochemical cycling in various ecosystems. While the factors that control the distribution of viruses in surface aquatic environments are well-characterized, the abundance and distribution of continental subsurface viruses with respect to microbial abundance and biogeochemical parameters have not yet been established. In order to begin to understand the factors governing virus distribution in subsurface environments, we assessed microbial cell and virus abundance in groundwater concurrent with groundwater chemistry in a uranium impacted alluvial aquifer adjoining the Colorado River near Rifle, CO. Virus abundance ranged from 8.0 × 104 to 1.0 × 106 mL−1 and exceeded cell abundance in all samples (cell abundance ranged from 5.8 × 104 to 6.1 × 105 mL−1). The virus to microbial cell ratio ranged from 1.1 to 8.1 and averaged 3.0 ± 1.6 with virus abundance most strongly correlated to cell abundance (Spearman's ρ = 0.73, p {\textless} 0.001). Both viruses and cells were positively correlated to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with cells having a slightly stronger correlation (Spearman's ρ = 0.46, p {\textless} 0.05 and ρ = 0.54, p {\textless} 0.05; respectively). Groundwater uranium was also strongly correlated with DOC and virus and cell abundance (Spearman's ρ = 0.62, p {\textless} 0.05; ρ = 0.46, p {\textless} 0.05; and ρ = 0.50, p {\textless} 0.05; respectively). Together the data indicate that microbial cell and virus abundance are correlated to the geochemical conditions in the aquifer. As such local geochemical conditions likely control microbial host cell abundance which in turn controls viral abundance. Given the potential impacts of viral-mediated cell lysis such as liberation of labile organic matter from lysed cells and changes in microbial community structure, viral interactions with the microbiota should be considered in an effort to understand subsurface biogeochemical cycling and contaminant mobility.},

	abstract = {The potential for microbially catalyzed NO3--dependent oxidation of solid-phase Fe(II) compounds was examined using a previously described autotrophic, denitrifying, Fe(II)-oxidizing enrichment culture. The following solid-phase Fe(II)-bearing minerals were considered:  microbially reduced synthetic goethite, two different end products of microbially hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) reduction (biogenic Fe3O4 and biogenic FeCO3), chemically precipitated FeCO3, and two microbially reduced iron(III) oxide-rich subsoils. The microbially reduced goethite, subsoils, and chemically precipitated FeCO3 were subject to rapid NO3--dependent Fe(II) oxidation. Significant oxidation of biogenic Fe3O4 was observed. Very little biogenic FeCO3 was oxidized. No reduction of NO3- or oxidation of Fe(II) occurred in pasteurized cultures. The molar ratio of NO3- reduced to Fe(II) oxidized in cultures containing chemically precipitated FeCO3, and one of the microbially reduced subsoils approximated the theoretical stoichiometry of 0.2:1. However, molar ratios obtained for oxidation of microbially reduced goethite, the other subsoil, and the HFO reduction end products did not agree with this theoretical value. These discrepancies may be related to heterotrophic NO3- reduction coupled to oxidation of dead Fe(III)-reducing bacterial biomass. Our findings demonstrate that microbally catalyzed NO3--dependent Fe(II) oxidation has the potential to significantly accelerate the oxidation of solid-phase Fe(II) compounds by oxidized N species. This process could have an important influence on the migration of contaminant metals and radionuclides in subsurface environments.},

	abstract = {Laboratory studies to evaluate the use of electricity for fracturing various grades of Colorado oil shale were started in 1964. Breakdown voltages varied greatly from one grade of shale to another, ranging from a minimum of 300 v to a maximum of 15,000 v. With few exceptions, the shale samples were readily fractured at relatively low current levels. On the basis of encouraging results obtained in the laboratory, experiments were expanded to field tests to study electrical characteristics of oil shale when subjected to overburden pressure. These tests generally confirmed the laboratory experiments. Fracturing was accomplished at all electrode spacings used. The spacings varied from 3 to 129 ft. Based upon results obtained in these field experiments, additional fracturing tests were conducted in four shallow wells drilled in an oil shale formation. Some new permeable zones were created between wells. The induced permeability was improved by detonating two conventional nitroglycerin wellbore shots in one of the wells.Before an in situ retorting process can function, it is necessary to develop techniques to increase the permeability of the oil shale formation. Induced fracturing, the best method of increasing the effective permeability of oil-shale deposits, may be accomplished by hydraulic pressure, high explosives, high-voltage electricity or combinations of two or more of these. This article discusses the laboratory experiments and preliminary field tests being made to study high-voltage electricity as a method of fracturing oil shale. Fracturing is the first phase of the electrocarbonization process and is the phase with which this investigation is primarily concerned. Several investigators have studied the electrocarbonization process as applied in coal, petroleum and oil shale formations, but none has reported making field tests in Green River oil shale.Samples used for the preliminary tests to evaluate electrical properties of various types of oil shale ranged in size from 2 to 175 lb and represented a broad spectrum of Colorado oil shales ranging from 1.5 to 58.6 gal of oil per ton of shale. The first tests determined the breakdown voltage required to initiate a current flow of 5 milliamp through the sample. In all cases, 1/4-in. stainless steel tubes spaced 4 in. apart were used as the electrodes. Breakdown voltages varied greatly from one sample to another, ranging from 300 to 15,000 V.After it was definitely established that electrical fracturing could be accomplished, other factors related to an in situ retorting process were investigated. The first of these was the establishment of air communication between two or more holes drilled at different locations in the shale block. Experiments were conducted on several shale blocks in which three holes were drilled in a line and spaced 2 in. apart, with 1/4-in. perforated steel tubes cemented into the holes. In most cases, interconnecting fractures created by the electrical current permitted substantial amounts of air to flow between all three holes. In these experiments the entire length of the steel tubes served as the electrodes; under these conditions the fractures occurred at random along the low-resistance paths taken by the electric current.Fracturing at random is not a satisfactory solution to the problem. For an in situ retorting operation to be successful, a technique is required to create a system of horizontal fractures vertically spaced at preselected intervals. Accurate control of positioning the horizontal fractures is essential because the combustion process may require a vertical spacing between fractures of as little as 1 or 2 ftIn Feb., 1965, experiments were initiated to investigate the feasibility of creating a controlled system of horizontal fractures. Electrodes used in these experiments were designed to concentrate the current at a small, well defined contact point. The first experiments were made with slabs of oil shale weighing 150 to 300 lb. Horizontal fractures were induced at preselected levels vertically spaced at 3-in. intervals (Fig. 1).Based on these results the experiments were expanded to involve oil shale slabs weighing several tons. The slab shown in Fig. 2 assayed at 55.7 gal of oil per ton. The top of the slab was first leveled off by inducing a fracture at the base of the peak. Two 1-in. diameter holes spaced 4 ft apart were drilled to a depth of 36 in.JPTP. 37ˆ},

With large samples of Shandong grey granite being the experimental subject, this paper conducted hydraulic fracturing experiment under triaxial stress at 20°C, 100°C, 200°C, 300°C and 400°C, analyzed the characteristic of water pressure loading curves in the experiment, and found that crack initiation pressure decreased remarkably after 300°C. In order to verify the factors controlling the influence of temperature on crack initiation, this paper established a strong transient thermal stress model, carried out numerical computation on this model and compared it with the experimental results. The results showed that the cooling effect of fracturing fluid for high temperature borehole can lead to thermal shock phenomenon and cause tensile stress near the borehole surface; the area near the borehole experienced two impact shocks, namely, elastic wave and thermal wave; the mechanism for the effect of temperature on the hydraulic fracturing of granite is not changes of rock mechanical parameters, but the thermal shock generated by the action of fracturing fluid of rock at high temperature.},

	abstract = {To understand the effects of thermal shock on microcrack propagation and permeability in coal, thermal shock tests were conducted on coal specimens by using a constant temperature drying oven (105 °C) and a SLX program controlled cryogenic tank. The growth and propagation of microcracks were measured with computer tomography (CT) scanning and scanning electron microscope (SEM) tests. Results showed that thermal shocks improved the permeability of coal significantly. Notably, the permeability of coal after thermal shocks increased from 211.31\% to 368.99\% and was positively correlated with temperature difference. CT scanning images revealed that thermal shocks increased the crack number, crack volume and crack width as well as smoothened and widened the gas flow paths, thereby enhancing coal permeability. Moreover, SEM images showed that heating-cooling shocks created more new microcracks, forming more complex crack propagation paths and better connectivity among microcracks in coal compared to cooling shocks. We proposed a crack propagation criterion for coal to explain the mechanism of crack failure and propagation during thermal shocks. Our experiment results and theoretical analysis indicate that the heating-cooling shock is more effective in damaging and breaking coal than the cooling shock. Thus, it can be used as an alternative approach to enhance coal permeability in the production of coalbed methane (CBM).},

Conventional monitoring methods (microseismic, pressure gauges, tracers, etc.) can provide a range of information about the stimulated rock volume but may often be limited in detail or clouded by uncertainty. Utilization of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) as a fracture monitoring tool is growing; however, most of the applications have been limited to acoustic frequency bands of the DAS recorded signal. In this paper, we demonstrate some examples of using the low-frequency band of DAS signal to constrain hydraulic-fracture geometry. DAS data were acquired in both offset horizontal and vertical monitor wells. In horizontal wells, DAS data record formation strain perturbation due to fracture propagation. Events like fracture opening and closing, stress shadow creation and relaxation, ball seat, and plug isolation can be clearly identified. In vertical wells, DAS response agrees well with colocated pressure and temperature gauges, and illuminates the vertical extent of hydraulic fractures. We show that DAS data in the low-frequency band is a powerful attribute to monitor small strain and temperature perturbation in or near the monitor wells. With different fibered monitor well design, we can measure the far-field fracture length, height, width, and density using crosswell DAS observations.},

	abstract = {Homogenizing the constitutive response of materials with nonlinear and history-dependent behavior at the microscale is particularly challenging. In this case, the only option is generally to homogenize numerically via concurrent multiscale models (CMMs). Unfortunately, these methods are not practical as their computational cost becomes prohibitive for engineering-scale applications. In this work, we develop an alternative formulation to CMMs that leverage state-of-the-art micromechanical modeling and advanced machine learning techniques to develop what we call smart constitutive laws (SCLs). We propose a training scheme for our SCLs that makes them suitable for arbitrary loading histories, making them equivalent to traditional constitutive models. We also show how to implement a SCL into a traditional finite element solver and investigate the response of an engineering-scale component. We compare our results to those obtained via a high fidelity simulation. Our findings indicate that SCLs can dramatically boost the computational efficiency and scalability of computational homogenization for nonlinear and history-dependent materials with arbitrary microstructures, enabling in this way the automatic and systematic generation of microstructurally-informed constitutive laws that can be adopted for the solution of macro-scale complex structures.},

	abstract = {Bio-particulate matter includes grains, cereal crops, and biomass that are considered discrete materials with irregular size and shape. Although the flow of these particles can behave like a continuum fluid at times, their discontinuous behavior cannot be simulated with traditional continuum-based modeling. The Discrete Element Method (DEM), coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is considered a promising numerical method that can model discrete particles by tracking the motion of each particle in fluid flow. DEM has been extensively used in the field of engineering, where its application is starting to achieve the popularity in agricultural processing. While CFD has been able to simulate the complex fluid flows with a quantitative and qualitative description of the temporal and spatial change of the flow field. This paper reviews the recent strategies and the existing applications of the CFD–DEM coupling approach in aerodynamic systems of bio-particles. It mainly represents four principal aspects: the definition of aerodynamic systems with its principals, modeling of particle motion including interaction forces of particle–particle and particle–fluid in the system, CFD–DEM coupling methodologies, and drag correlation models with theoretical developments, and the applications of aerodynamic systems related to the agricultural field. The existing published literature indicates that CFD–DEM is a promising approach to study the bio-particulate matter behavior immersed in fluid flow, and it could be benefiting from developing and optimizing the device's geometry and the operations. The main findings are discussed and summarized as a part of the review, where future developments and challenges are highlighted.},

	abstract = {Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) have the potential to make a significant contribution to the world energy inventory. One controversial issue associated with EGS, however, is the impact of induced seismicity or microseismicity, which has been the cause of delays and threatened cancellation of at least two EGS projects worldwide. Although microseismicity has in fact had few (or no) adverse physical effects on operations or on surrounding communities, there remains public concern over the amount and magnitude of the seismicity associated with current and future EGS operations. The primary objectives of this paper are to present an up-to-date review of what is already known about the seismicity induced during the creation and operation of EGS, and of the gaps in our knowledge that, once addressed, should lead to an improved understanding of the mechanisms generating the events. Several case histories also illustrate a number of technical and public acceptance issues. We conclude that EGS-induced seismicity need not pose a threat to the development of geothermal energy resources if site selection is carried out properly, community issues are handled adequately and operators understand the underlying mechanisms causing the events. Induced seismicity could indeed prove beneficial, in that it can be used to monitor the effectiveness of EGS operations and shed light on geothermal reservoir processes.},

Microseismic monitoring provides a unique tool to monitor the evolution of fracturing around the treated rock reservoir, and seismic source mechanisms can yield information about the nature of deformation. We performed a numerical modeling study using a 2D distinct-element particle flow code to simulate realistic conditions and increase understanding of fracturing mechanisms in naturally fractured reservoirs, through comparisons with results of the geometry of hydraulic fractures and seismic source information (locations, magnitudes, and mechanisms) from both laboratory experiments and field observations. A suite of numerical models with fully dynamic and hydromechanical coupling was used to examine the interaction between natural and induced fractures, the effect of orientation of a preexisting fracture, the influence of differential stress, and the relationship between the fluid front, fracture tip, and induced seismicity. The numerical results qualitatively agree with the laboratory and field observations, and suggest possible mechanics for new fracture development and their interaction with a natural fracture (e.g., a tectonic fault). Therefore, the tested model could help in investigating the potential extent of induced fracturing in naturally fractured reservoirs, and in interpreting microseismic monitoring results to assess the effectiveness of a hydraulic fracturing project.},

The performance of the model increases with time and distance from injection, accordingly with the presumed less dominant role of the pore pressure further from the injection well and after shut-in. We analyze the sensitivity of results to location and focal mechanism uncertainties, the fault-plane ambiguity, and the friction coefficient. We find that ΔCFS are highly sensitive to location accuracy but robust with regard to uncertainties of the other parameters.

	abstract = {We describe a numerical investigation of seismicity induced by injection into a single isolated fracture. Injection into a single isolated fracture is a simple analog for shear stimulation in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) during which water is injected into fractured, low permeability rock, triggering slip on preexisting large scale fracture zones. A model was developed and used that couples (1) fluid flow, (2) rate and state friction, and (3) mechanical stress interaction between fracture elements. Based on the results of this model, we propose a mechanism to describe the process by which the stimulated region grows during shear stimulation, which we refer to as the sequential stimulation (SS) mechanism. If the SS mechanism is realistic, it would undermine assumptions that are made for the estimation of the minimum principal stress and unstimulated hydraulic diffusivity. We investigated the effect of injection pressure on induced seismicity. For injection at constant pressure, there was not a significant dependence of maximum event magnitude on injection pressure, but there were more relatively large events for higher injection pressure. Decreasing injection pressure over time significantly reduced the maximum event magnitude. Significant seismicity occurred after shut-in, which was consistent with observations from EGS stimulations. Production of fluid from the well immediately after injection inhibited shut-in seismic events. The results of the model in this study were found to be broadly consistent with results from prior work using a simpler treatment of friction that we refer to as static/dynamic. We investigated the effect of shear-induced pore volume dilation and the rate and state characteristic length scale,

	abstract = {The standard model of injection-induced seismicity considers changes in Coulomb strength due solely to changes in pore pressure. We consider two additional effects: full poroelastic coupling of stress and pore pressure, and time-dependent earthquake nucleation. We model stress and pore pressure due to specified injection rate in a homogeneous, poroelastic medium. Stress and pore pressure are used to compute seismicity rate through the Dieterich (1994) model. For constant injection rate, the time to reach a critical seismicity rate scales with t ∼ r2/(cfc), where r is distance from the injector, c is hydraulic diffusivity, and fc is a factor that depends on mechanical properties, and weakly on r. The seismicity rate decays following a peak, consistent with some observations. During injection poroelastic coupling may increase or decrease the seismicity rate, depending on the orientation of the faults relative to the injector. If injection-induced stresses inhibit slip, abrupt shut-in can lead to locally sharp increases in seismicity rate; tapering the flux mitigates this effect. The maximum magnitude event has been observed to occur postinjection. We suggest the seismicity rate at a given magnitude depends on the nucleation rate, the size distribution of fault segments, and if the background shear stress is low, the time-varying volume of perturbed crust. This leads to a rollover in frequency-magnitude distribution for larger events, with a “corner” that increases with time. Larger events are absent at short times, but approach the background frequency with time; larger events occurring post shut-in are thus not unexpected.},

In particular, seismicity induced by fluid injection and withdrawal has emerged as a central element of the scientific discussion around subsurface technologies that tap into water and energy resources. Here we present a new computational approach to model coupled multiphase flow and geomechanics of faulted reservoirs. We represent faults as surfaces embedded in a three-dimensional medium by using zero-thickness interface elements to accurately model fault slip under dynamically evolving fluid pressure and fault strength. We incorporate the effect of fluid pressures from multiphase flow in the mechanical stability of faults and employ a rigorous formulation of nonlinear multiphase geomechanics that is capable of handling strong capillary effects. We develop a numerical simulation tool by coupling a multiphase flow simulator with a mechanics simulator, using the unconditionally stable fixed-stress scheme for the sequential solution of two-way coupling between flow and geomechanics. We validate our modeling approach using several synthetic, but realistic, test cases that illustrate the onset and evolution of earthquakes from fluid injection and withdrawal.},

It is an integrated analysis from cause to consequence, including the whole chain of processes starting from earthquake inception in the subsurface, wave propagation toward the ground surface, and assessment of the consequences of ground vibration. For a small magnitude (Mw=3) event at a hypocenter depth of about 1000m, we first used the simulated ground-motion wave train in an inverse analysis to estimate source parameters (moment magnitude, rupture dimensions and stress drop), achieving good agreement and thereby verifying the modeling of the chain of processes from earthquake inception to ground vibration. We then analyzed the ground vibration results in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV) and frequency content, with comparison to U.S. Geological Survey's instrumental intensity scales for earthquakes and the U.S. Bureau of Mines’ vibration criteria for cosmetic damage to buildings, as well as human-perception vibration limits. Our results confirm the appropriateness of using PGV (rather than PGA) and frequency for the evaluation of potential ground-vibration effects on structures and humans from shallow injection-induced seismic events. For the considered synthetic Mw=3 event, our analysis showed that the short duration, high frequency ground motion may not cause any significant damage to surface structures, but would certainly be felt by the local population.},

	abstract = {We constructed a coupled model to obtain a better understanding of the role of pore pressure changes in causing fracture reactivation and seismicity during enhanced geothermal systems operation (EGS). We implemented constitutive models for fractures in a continuum approach, which is advantageous because of the ease of integration in existing geomechanical codes (FLAC3D), the speed of the calculations and the flexibility of the fracture representation. For modeling the mechanical behavior of the fracture zone the softening ubiquitous joints model was used with random strength properties for the fracture zone. We implemented a hyperbolic deformation with effective stress for the reversible tensile fracture opening (used for fracture permeability), and a linear relationship between plastic shear strain and irreversible fracture opening. The effective permeability of the fracture network was described by a cubic dependence on the fracture aperture. Seismic events were simulated using a dynamic friction angle smaller than the static friction angle, and healing to the static friction angle was allowed after completion of a seismic event. We created a model inspired on the Soultz-sous-Forêts GPK3 injection well, where the granite rock mass is intersected by a dominant fracture zone. The model reproduced reactivation of the fracture zone due to injection of water and we observed the growth of a zone with large directional permeability. The model was used to perform a sensitivity analysis on parameters like in situ stress regime, fracture strength, and frictional weakening. This allowed us to evaluate the trends of their impact on fracture reactivation, including reactivated area, seismic moment and moment magnitudes. A comparison with a Block–Spring model as reported by Baisch et al. (2010) yielded similar results. The models were applied on the GPK3 stimulation case that was performed in Soultz in 2003. The basic features of the observed seismicity were reproduced. The 3D implementation and the Block–Spring model showed their specific advantages: the Block–Spring model, if calibrated, establishes a fast modeling tool for sensitivity analyses; the FLAC3D implementation allows better understanding as it is based on actual physics.},

Storage of CO2 in deep saline formations or depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs requires estimates of sustainable fluid pressures that will not induce fracturing or create fault permeability that could lead to CO2 escape. Analyses of fault stability require the determination of fault orientations, ambient pore fluid pressures and in situ stresses in a potential storage site. The calculation of effective stresses that act on faults and reservoir rocks lead then to estimates of fault slip tendency and fluid pressures sustainable during CO2 storage. These parameters can be visualized on 3D images of fault surfaces or in 2D projections. Faults that are unfavourably oriented for reactivation can be identified from failure plots. In depleted oil and gas fields, modelling of fault and rock stability needs to incorporate changes of the pre-production stresses that were induced by hydrocarbon production and associated pore pressure depletion. Such induced stress changes influence the maximum sustainable formation pressures and CO2 storage volumes. Hence, determination of in situ stresses and modelling of fault stability are essential prerequisites for the safe engineering of subsurface CO2 injection and the modelling of storage capacity.},

First, fault hydromechanical models were tested to investigate fault behavior using different mechanical modeling approaches, including slip interface and finite-thickness elements with isotropic or anisotropic elasto-plastic constitutive models. The results of this investigation showed that fault hydromechanical behavior can be appropriately represented with the least complex alternative, using a finite-thickness element and isotropic plasticity. We utilized this pragmatic approach coupled with a strain-permeability model to study hydromechanical effects on fault instability during deep underground injection of CO2. We demonstrated how such a modeling approach can be applied to determine the likelihood of fault reactivation and to estimate the associated loss of CO2 from the injection zone. It is shown that shear-enhanced permeability initiated where the fault intersects the injection zone plays an important role in propagating fault instability and permeability enhancement through the overlying caprock.},

Pressure build-up induced by CO2 injection will decrease the effective stresses and may affect fault stability. Geomechanical effects of overpressure induced by CO2 injection either in the hanging wall or in the foot wall on fault stability are investigated. CO2 injection in the presence of a low-permeable fault induces pressurization of the storage formation between the injection well and the fault. The low permeability of the fault hinders fluid flow across it and leads to smaller overpressure on the other side of the fault. This variability in the fluid pressure distribution gives rise to differential total stress changes around the fault that reduce its stability. Despite a significant pressure build-up induced by the fault, caprock stability around the injection well is not compromised and thus, CO2 leakage across the caprock is unlikely to happen. The decrease in fault stability is similar regardless of the side of the fault where CO2 is injected. Simulation results show that fault core permeability has a significant effect on fault stability, becoming less affected for high-permeable faults. An appropriate pressure management will allow storing large quantities of CO2 without inducing fault reactivation.},

Two numerical modeling approaches for analyzing fault-slip are applied, one using continuum stress–strain analysis and the other using discrete fault analysis. The results of these two approaches to numerical fault-slip analyses are compared to the results of a more conventional analytical fault-slip analysis that assumes simplified reservoir geometry. It is shown that the simplified analytical fault-slip analysis may lead to either overestimation or underestimation of the maximum sustainable injection pressure because it cannot resolve important geometrical factors associated with the injection-induced spatial evolution of fluid pressure and stress. We conclude that a fully coupled numerical analysis can more accurately account for the spatial evolution of both in situ stresses and fluid pressure, and therefore results in a more accurate estimation of the maximum sustainable CO2 injection pressure.},

	abstract = {Faults comprise zones of crushed, sheared and fractured rock that have the potential to influence the migration of stored CO2. Fault-zone permeabilities of 10-9 to 10-19 m2 are controlled by many interdependent factors including; fault-zone architecture and rock types, mechanical strength and permeability of host rock, orientation and magnitude of in situ stresses, fracture aperture size and connectivity, fluid properties and burial history. Mitigating the risk of CO2 migration via faults to the atmosphere or into economically valuable resources requires an understanding of the conditions under which they promote fluid flow from the reservoir. In situ flow data from natural seeps indicate that faults can promote the upward flow of CO2, with flux rates being greatest where the highest densities of fractures occur. Flow simulation modelling suggests that low-permeability fault rock may compartmentalise reservoirs giving rise to increased pressures and promoting upward flow of CO2. Migration rates along faults of up to 1000 m/yr are possible and could produce leakage rates of up to 15000 t/yr at natural seeps. These rates are likely to be site specific and positively related to reservoir pressures. Present understanding of fault hydraulic properties is generally not sufficiently complete to predict when and where faults will influence CO2 migration. To improve understanding of fault hydraulic properties, studies of outcrop, analogue and numerical models are required. In situ flow measurements are critical for testing site-specific and generic fault fluid-flow models that are important in establishing guidelines for the inclusion of faults in risk assessment and determining what mitigation measures are most appropriate.},

	abstract = {Calcite veins are commonly found at shallow depth (a few metres below the surface) in damage zones of active normal fault systems in southwest Turkey. Although earlier studies demonstrated the link between the vein formation and seismicity, the association of near-surface carbonate precipitation with climate-driven hydrological conditions (water table, amount of precipitation and evaporation, and water discharge) is poorly understood. In this study, using the U/Th dating method we investigate the timing of vein formation and the interrelationship between tectonic and climatic-related hydrological processes. Carbonate precipitation is interpreted to occur as a result of sudden pressure drops and CO2 release after earthquake-induced fracturing. Vein formation mostly occurred during glacial periods, which coincide with slow growth rates and higher oxygen isotope values of speleothems from the Eastern Mediterranean region. We relate these episodes to reduced winter rainfall due to the decrease in westerly ﬂow in SW Turkey. These somewhat drier conditions inﬂuenced the chemical composition of circulating water, creating conditions conducive to carbonate precipitation and sealing of damage zones. These conditions also facilitated CO2 accumulation and overpressure build-up in the rupture zones. Failure of the faults resulted in the release of large volumes of CO2-rich ﬂuids and the generation of shallow carbonate veins. It is proposed that during phases of increased winter rainfall CO2 is advected to the surface and discharged as passive degassing when meteoric water circulation is enhanced. While regional tectonics is the ultimate driver of fault activity and fracture formation, climate-driven near-surface hydrological changes may have played an important role in modulating CO2-rich ﬂuid circulation and surface discharge.},

Through numerical analysis, we compare several models where the complexity of the fault-zone architecture and different layers (such as caprock and injection reservoir) are incrementally included. Results show how the presence of hydraulic and mechanical heterogeneity along the fault influences the pressure diffusion, as well as the effective normal and shear stress evolution. Hydromechanical heterogeneities (i) strengthen the fault zone resulting in earthquakes of small magnitude, and (ii) impede fluid migration upward along the fault. We also study the effects of the caprock and aquifer thickness on the resulting induced seismicity and CO2 leakage, both in heterogeneous and homogeneous fault zones. Results show that a thin caprock or aquifer allows smaller events, but a much higher percentage of leakage through the caprock and into the upper aquifer. The amount of leakage reduces drastically in the case of a multi-caprock, multi-aquifer system.},

	abstract = {The interaction between mechanical deformation and fluid flow in fault zones gives rise to a host of coupled hydro-mechanical processes fundamental to fault instability, induced seismicity, and associated fluid migration. Fault stability is studied in the context of the Heletz site which was chosen as a test site for CO2 injection experiment in the framework of the EU- MUSTANG project. The potential reservoir for CO2 storage at the Heletz site consists of three sandstone layers that are approximately one, two and nine meters in thickness, separated by impermeable shale layers of various thicknesses, and overlaid by a five-meter limestone and a thick impermeable shale, which serves as caprock. The storage formation is intersected by two pre-existing sub-vertical normal faults (F1 and F2) on two opposite sides of the injection point. A hydro-mechanical model was developed to study the interaction between mechanical deformation and fluid flow in the two faults during CO2 injection and storage. We evaluate the consequences caused by potential fault reactivation, namely, the fault slip and the CO2 leakage through the caprock. The difference in the results obtained by considering the three-layer storage formation as an equivalent single-layer storage formation is analysed. It was found that for the two cases the pore pressure evolution is similar, but the differences in the evolution of CO2 saturation are significant, which is attributed to the differences in CO2 spread in a single and three-layer storage. No fault reactivation was observed in either case. A sensitivity analysis was made to study the influence of the fault dip angle, the ratio between the horizontal and vertical stresses, the offset of the layers across fault F2, the initial permeability of the fault and the permeability of the confinement formations. Results show that reactivation of faults F1 and F2 is most sensitive to the stress ratio, the initial permeability of the faults and the permeability of the confinement formations. The offset of the layers across the fault F2 was also found to be an important parameter, mainly because an offset leads to an increase in CO2 leakage. Changes in permeability were found to be small because plastic shear strains induced by the reactivation of the faults and associated increase in volumetric strains and permeability, occur mainly in a fault section of only 10 m length, which is the approximate total thickness of the storage layers.},

We contrast the behavior of shale faults with another set of experiments conducted in carbonates. Significant fluid leakage occurs along the initially low-permeability shale faults when rupture is activated. Most of the leakage pathway closes when fluid injection ceases and fluid pressure drops. Dilatant slip on the fault plane alone does not explain the observed leakage behavior, which is also caused by fault opening favored by the softness of the shale, and by the structure of the fault zone that prevents fluids from diffusing into the adjacent damage zone. Experiments show a large amount of aseismic deformation. Small-magnitude seismicity (Mw {\textless} -2.5) is observed outside the pressurized leakage patch. Stress transferred from this aseismic deformation patch can build up to stress-criticality and favor seismicity. Thus, in terms of fault activation in caprocks, aseismic fault slip leading to increased permeability and a loss of seal integrity is of great concern.},

	abstract = {The potential economic benefits offered by CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) and storage, including increasing oil production and mitigating CO2 storage cost, make it an attractive approach for reducing CO2 emissions. Sealing formation (caprock) integrity is considered a key risk factor, because of the potential for leaked CO2 or brine migrating into shallow groundwater formations. The primary purpose of this research is to evaluate general caprock sealing efficiency and integrity under typical CO2-EOR conditions, by assessing the influence of hydrological and mineralogical heterogeneity, possible mineralogical alteration, and potential failure of rock due to hydrological and mineralogical changes. An active CO2-EOR project at the Farnsworth Unit (FWU) in the northern Texas is selected as a case study. A coupled reactive-transport-geomechanics model of the FWU caprock (the Morrow Shale and the Thirteen Fingers Limestone) was developed based on site-specific geological data. Key results suggest that the Thirteen Fingers Limestone is an effective caprock. After 5,000 years, effectively no supercritical CO2 penetrates this formation, and the penetration depth of dissolved CO2 in aqueous phase does not exceed 10 m. Because of mineral precipitation in the Morrow Shale, maximum porosity decreases 25\% at the reservoir-caprock interface, suggesting increased caprock sealing efficiency. Geomechanical response of the caprock due to CO2 intrusion and mineral alteration suggests low risk of induced fractures. This study provides a refined evaluation of long-term caprock integrity as a function of coupled hydrological, chemical, and geomechanical processes and is intended to support future assessment of feasibility and safety of geologic CO2 sequestration.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is likely to reach the bottom of injection wells at a colder temperature than that of the storage formation, causing cooling of the rock. This cooling, together with overpressure, tends to open up fractures, which may enhance injectivity. We investigate cooling effects on injectivity enhancement by modeling the In Salah CO2 storage site and a theoretical, long-term injection case. We use stress-dependent permeability functions that predict an increase in permeability as the effective stress acting normal to fractures decreases. Normal effective stress can decrease either due to overpressure or cooling. We calibrate our In Salah model, which includes a fracture zone perpendicular to the well, obtaining a good fitting with the injection pressure measured at KB-502 and the rapid CO2 breakthrough that occurred at the observation well KB-5 located 2km away from the injection well. CO2 preferentially advances through the fracture zone, which becomes two orders of magnitude more permeable than the rest of the reservoir. Nevertheless, the effect of cooling on the long-term injectivity enhancement is limited in pressure dominated storage sites, like at In Salah, because most of the permeability enhancement is due to overpressure. However, thermal effects enhance injectivity in cooling dominated storage sites, which may decrease the injection pressure by 20\%, saving a significant amount of compression energy all over the duration of storage projects. Overall, our simulation results show that cooling has the potential to enhance injectivity in fractured reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Poro-elastic stress and effective stress reduction associated with deep underground fluid injection can potentially trigger shear rupture along pre-existing faults. We modeled an idealized CO2 injection scenario, to assess the effects on faults in the first phase of a generic CO2 aquifer storage operation. We used coupled multiphase fluid flow and geomechanical numerical modeling to evaluate the stress and pressure perturbations induced by fluid injection and the response of a nearby normal fault. Slip-rate dependent friction and inertial effects have been taken into account during rupture. Contact elements have been used to take into account the frictional behavior of the rupture plane. We investigated different scenarios of injection rate to induce rupture on the fault, employing various fault rheologies. Published laboratory data on CO2-saturated intact and crushed rock samples, representative of a potential target aquifer, sealing formation and fault gouge, have been used to define a scenario where different fault rheologies apply at different depths. Nucleation of fault rupture takes place at the bottom of the reservoir, in agreement with analytical poro-elastic stress calculations, depending on injection-induced reservoir inflation and the tectonic stress scenario. For the stress state considered here, the first triggered rupture always produces the largest rupture length and slip magnitude, both of which correlate with the fault rheology. Velocity weakening produces larger ruptures and generates larger magnitude seismic events. Heterogeneous faults have been considered including velocity-weakening or velocity strengthening sections inside and below the aquifer, with the upper sections being velocity-neutral. Nucleation of rupture in a velocity-strengthening section results in a limited rupture extension, both in terms of maximum slip and rupture length. For a heterogeneous fault with nucleation in a velocity-weakening section, the rupture may propagate into the overlying velocity-neutral section, if the extent of velocity-weakening and associated friction drop are large enough.},

Such human-induced seismicity is a key environmental concern related to the exploitation of natural underground resources. Thus, understanding how to avoid triggering felt earthquakes plays a crucial role in the success of underground anthropogenic activities, such as CO2 geological storage. In this work, we conduct 3D simulations of injection-triggered fault reactivation, in order to investigate the effects of well geometry on seismic rupture and CO2 leakage. We analyze two different cases of injection, through (1) a vertical and (2) a horizontal well. Simulation results for the vertical well show the fault pressurizing faster and more locally than for the horizontal well, resulting in a smaller seismic event. For the horizontal well, the pressure is distributed over a wider area along the fault, which requires a longer time to reactivate, but results in a larger event. Fault reactivation also produces changes in damage-zone and fault-core permeability, allowing the CO2 to leak from the injection zone through overlying caprock, toward shallower depths. Although the calculated fault permeability enhancement is similar for the two cases, results show a slightly higher leakage rate for the vertical well in the region close to the well itself, while the leakage resulting from injection through the horizontal well is more widely distributed.Published 2015.

The fractured system was modeled as a low-permeability fault core surrounded by a fractured damage zone, as would be expected for a low-porosity caprock that underwent brittle deformation. To represent the damage zone, we introduced heterogeneities in the initial permeability field by using a grid-based continuum model where the upscaling relationship for permeability as a function of fracture aperture and density is given by an analytical expression. The first mitigation strategy, injection of a drying agent (dry CO2 here) below the damage zone, leads to precipitation of solids and local decreases in permeability that cause lateral migration of the leak and self-sealing of the fractured system. The higher the maximum value of the permeability in the damage zone, the less time required to reduce the leak rate. The second mitigation strategy evaluated controlled permeability reduction in the fractured zone by simulating an idealized emplaced sealant. Collectively, modeling results suggest that knowledge of the hydrodynamics of the leak is required to optimize the location of sealant applications within the fracture zone.},

However, the elevated fluid pressure during CO2 injection changes the stress states in the caprock, and may lead to reactivate pre-existing fractures or even fracture the caprock. It is necessary to develop an efficient and practical monitor technology to detect and identify CO2 leakage pathways. To this end, we should understand the transport behavior of CO2 coupled with geomechanical effects during injection. In this work, we first developed an efficient parallel fully-coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical simulator to model CO2 transport in porous media. The numerical model was verified through classical problems with analytical solutions. Then, based on this simulator, we investigated the fluid flow behavior when CO2 leakage occurs through fluid-driven fracture zones. We proposed an implicit, physics-based model to simulate the fluid-driven fracturing process by using several practical correlations, including fracturing pressure functions, porosity/permeability–stress relationships. A set of numerical simulations have been conducted by considering various scenarios, such as different injection rates, locations and distributions of fracture zones, and initial fracture permeability. The results show that there are several characteristics can be used to detect CO2 leakage pathways, and it is possible to develop an advanced inverse modeling and monitoring technology to identify leakage locations, times and rates using measured pressure data of permanent downhole gauges and our simulator.},

	abstract = {The effect of CO2–water–rock interactions on fracture mechanical properties of reservoir and seal rocks due to injection of CO2 in the subsurface may impact long-term (102–104 yr) storage security. At the Crystal Geyser and Salt Wash field sites near Green River, Utah, sandstone of the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation and Mancos Shale have undergone chemical alteration associated with flow of CO2-bearing water under natural conditions over geologic time scales of 103–105 yrs. To quantify the effects of these diagenetic changes on rock fracture mechanical properties we conducted opening-mode fracture mechanics tests using the double torsion method on a suite of CO2-altered and unaltered siliciclastic samples. We show that dissolution of hematite and carbonate cement in Entrada Sandstone by CO2-rich brine lowers fracture toughness by nearly 40\% relative to adjacent, unaltered samples from the same unit. In contrast, precipitation of calcite pore cement in a sandstone of the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation, attributed to CO2 degassing during upward fluid flow along the Little Grand Wash Fault, results in a 100–700\% increase in fracture toughness. Similarly, precipitation of carbonate mineral cements and replacement of matrix measurably strengthens Mancos Shale, considered a regional top seal. Subcritical fracture growth index (SCI) which quantifies reaction-assisted subcritical fracture propagation is also affected by CO2-related alteration. Based on previous numerical simulations of fracture network growth with varying fracture mechanical parameters, we find that the measured variations in fracture mechanical properties qualitatively match observed differences in opening-mode fracture distributions along the fault, with short, non-connected fractures in CO2-bleached rock, long, throughgoing fractures in calcite-cemented shale, and short, closely spaced, interconnected fracture networks in highly altered rock directly adjacent to fault conduits. Our fracture mechanics tests demonstrate that fracture mechanical properties of reservoir and seal rock can change as a result of chemical CO2–brine–rock interaction. These chemical interactions may favor or inhibit subcritical fracture growth processes and thus reservoir and seal flow properties. In regions of CO2-related mineral dissolution, subcritical fracture growth may reduce seal integrity over time scales beyond those of active injection and reservoir monitoring, thus negatively affecting seal integrity over the expected design lifetime of a CO2 reservoir.},

	abstract = {Instances of gas leakage from naturally occurring CO2 reservoirs and natural gas storage sites serve as analogues for the potential release of CO2 from geologic storage sites. This paper summarizes and compares the features, events, and processes that can be identified from these analogues, which include both naturally occurring releases and those associated with industrial processes. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) carbon dioxide can accumulate beneath, and be released from, primary and secondary shallower reservoirs with capping units located at a wide range of depths; (2) many natural releases of CO2 are correlated with a specific event that triggered the release; (3) unsealed fault and fracture zones may act as conduits for CO2 flow from depth to the surface; (4) improperly constructed or abandoned wells can rapidly release large quantities of CO2; (5) the types of CO2 release at the surface vary widely between and within different leakage sites; (6) the hazard to human health was small in most cases, possibly because of implementation of post-leakage public education and monitoring programs; (7) while changes in groundwater chemistry were related to CO2 leakage, waters often remained potable. Lessons learned for risk assessment associated with geologic carbon sequestration are discussed.},

	abstract = {Thermal effects are an important component in the analysis of geologic carbon storage because the injected CO2 reaches the storage formation at a lower temperature than that of the reservoir rock. The main fear is related to the possibility that the shear slip that may occur within the reservoir due to cooling could propagate into the caprock, which could result in CO2 leakage. We model a baserock–reservoir–caprock system in a normal faulting stress regime using an axisymmetric model in which we inject cold CO2 and use an elasto-plastic constitutive model to simulate inelastic deformation. CO2 forms a cold region around the injection well of a significantly smaller extension than the CO2 plume. Within this cold region, inelastic strain is yielded due to the thermal stress reduction caused by the thermal contraction of the rock. This inelastic strain occurs only within the reservoir and does not propagate into the caprock. Actually, the stability of the lower portion of the caprock improves in the cooled region as a result of a stress redistribution that occurs to satisfy stress equilibrium and displacement compatibility caused by the thermal stress reduction of the reservoir. This stress redistribution tightens the caprock and prevents CO2 leakage. Thus, thermally induced stresses are not likely to generate fracture propagation into the caprock in normal faulting stress regimes.},

	abstract = {Acidic reactive flow in fractures is relevant in subsurface activities, such as CO2 geological storage and hydraulic fracturing. Understanding reaction-induced changes in fracture hydrodynamic properties is essential for predicting subsurface flows, such as leakage, injectability, and fluid production. In this study, X-ray computed tomography scans of a fractured carbonate caprock were used to create three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the fracture before and after reaction with CO2-acidified brine (Ellis, B.; Peters, C.; Fitts, J.; Bromhal, G.; McIntyre, D.; Warzinski, R.; Rosenbaum, E. Deterioration of a fractured carbonate caprock exposed to CO2-acidified brine flow. Greenhouse Gases: Sci. Technol. 2011, 1, 248−260). As expected, mechanical apertures were found to increase substantially, doubling and even tripling in some places. However, the surface geometry evolved in complex ways, including “comb-tooth” structures created from preferential dissolution of calcite in transverse sedimentary bands and the creation of degraded zones, i.e., porous calcite-depleted areas on reacted fracture surfaces. These geometric alterations resulted in increased fracture roughness, as measured by surface Z2 parameters and fractal dimensions Df. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to quantify the changes in hydraulic aperture, fracture transmissivity, and permeability. The results show that the effective hydraulic apertures are smaller than the mechanical apertures and the changes in hydraulic apertures are nonlinear. Overestimation of the flow rate by a factor of 2 or more would be introduced if fracture hydrodynamic properties were based on mechanical apertures or if hydraulic aperture is assumed to change proportionally with mechanical aperture. The differences can be attributed, in part, to the increase in roughness after reaction and is likely affected by contiguous transverse sedimentary features. Hydraulic apertures estimated by the one-dimensional (1D) statistical model and two-dimensional (2D) local cubic law (LCL) model are consistently larger than those calculated from the CFD simulations. In addition, a novel ternary segmentation method was devised to handle the degraded zones, allowing for a bounding analysis of the effects on hydraulic properties. We found that the degraded zones account for less than 15\% of the fracture volume but cover 70–80\% of the fracture surface. When the degraded zones are treated as part of the fracture, the fracture transmissivities are 2–4 times larger because the fracture surfaces after reaction are not as rough as they would be if one considers the degraded zone as part of the rock. Therefore, while degraded zones created during geochemical reactions may not significantly increase mechanical aperture, this type of feature cannot be ignored and should be treated with prudence when predicting fracture hydrodynamic properties.},

Therefore, the sealing effectiveness of a caprock-fault system must be evaluated at various stages of CO2-EOR storage projects. This paper presents a new evaluation framework that considers specific site characteristics and a case study on the sealing effectiveness of the caprock-fault system in the Shengli Oilfield. The proposed method is a weighted ranking system where a set of 17 indicators has been developed for the assessment and ranking of the G89 block in terms of their sealing ability for CO2 sequestration. Additional indicators are involved in the method, such as the newly proposed parameter, frontier displacement work which reflects the influence of formation pressure, displacement pressure resistance, and caprock thickness. The new approach considers the sealing mechanisms of caprocks and faults as well as the configuration relationships between them. The method was used to evaluate the sealing effectiveness of the G89 block that has a considerable number of faults and good sealing ability of caprock in the Shengli Oilfield.},

Because of the abundance of silicate rocks and the permanence of the carbonated solids, sequestering CO2 via mineral carbonation has generated lots of interests. However, it is unclear how the fluid-rock reaction proceeds to completion in spite of an increasing solid volume. We conducted a mineral carbonation experiment in which a sintered olivine aggregate reacted with a sodium bicarbonate solution at reservoir conditions. Time-resolved synchrotron X-ray microtomographic images show cracks in polygonal patterns arising in the surface layers and propagating into the interior of the olivine aggregate. The nanotomography data reveal that the incipient cracks intersect at right angles. We infer that stretching due to nonuniform volume expansion generates polygonal cracking of the surfaces. Our data shed new lights on the processes that control hydration and carbonation of peridotite.},

	abstract = {This paper applies a multiscale hydro-geochemical-mechanical approach to analyze faulted CO2 reservoirs using the STOMP-CO2-R code that is coupled to the ABAQUS® finite element package. STOMP-CO2-R models the reactive transport of CO2 causing mineral composition changes that are captured by an Eshelby-Mori-Tanka model implemented in ABAQUS®. A three-dimensional (3D) STOMP-CO2-R model for a reservoir containing an inclined fault was built to analyze a formation containing a reaction network with five minerals: albite, anorthite, calcite, kaolinite, and quartz. A 3D finite element mesh that exactly maps the STOMP-CO2-R grid was developed for coupled analyses. The model contains alternating sandstone and shale layers. The impact of reactive transport of CO2 on the geomechanical properties of reservoir rocks are studied in terms of mineral composition changes that affect their geomechanical responses. Simulations assuming extensional and compressional stress regimes with and without coupled geochemistry are performed to study the stress regime effect on the risk of hydraulic fracture. The fault slip is examined as functions of stress regime, geomechanical, geochemical-mechanical effects, fault inclination, and position. The results show that mineralogical changes due to CO2 injection reduce the permeability and elastic modulus of the reservoir, leading to increased fluid pressure and risk of fracture in the injection location and the caprock seal. Shear failure in the fault leading to fault reactivation was not predicted to occur. However, stress regime, fault inclination, and fault position in light of the coupled hydro-geochemical-mechanical analysis have an important impact on the slip tendency factor and elastic fault slip. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

GCS is an approach being explored globally as a defense mechanism against climate change projections, although it is not without its critics. An important focus has been recently placed on understanding the coupling between rock–fluid geochemical alterations and mechanical changes for CO2 storage schemes in saline aquifers. This article presents a review of the current state of knowledge regarding CO2-induced geochemical reactions in subsurface reservoirs, and their potential impact on mechanical properties and microseismic events at CO2 storage sites. This review focuses, in particular, on the current state of the art in fluid–rock interactions within the GCS context. Key issues to be addressed include geochemical reactions and the alteration of transport and mechanical properties. Specific review topics include the swelling of clays, the prediction of dissolution and precipitation reaction rates, CO2-induced changes in porosity and permeability, constitutive models of chemo–mechanical interactions in rock, and correlations between geochemical reactions and induced seismicity.

	abstract = {Industrial-scale injection of CO2 into saline formations in sedimentary basins will cause large-scale fluid pressurization and migration of native brines, which may affect valuable groundwater resources overlying the deep sequestration aquifers. In this paper, we discuss how such basin-scale hydrogeologic impacts (1) may reduce current storage capacity estimates, and (2) can affect regulation of CO2 storage projects. Our assessment arises from a hypothetical future carbon sequestration scenario in the Illinois Basin, which involves twenty individual CO2 storage projects (sites) in a core injection area most suitable for long-term storage. Each project is assumed to inject five million tonnes of CO2 per year for 50 years. A regional-scale three-dimensional simulation model was developed for the Illinois Basin that captures both the local-scale CO2–brine flow processes and the large-scale groundwater flow patterns in response to CO2 storage. The far-field pressure buildup predicted for this selected sequestration scenario support recent studies in that environmental concerns related to near- and far-field pressure buildup may be a limiting factor on CO2 storage capacity. In other words, estimates of storage capacity, if solely based on the effective pore volume available for safe trapping of CO2, may have to be revised based on assessments of pressure perturbations and their potential impacts on caprock integrity and groundwater resources. Our results suggest that (1) the area that needs to be characterized in a permitting process may comprise a very large region within the basin if reservoir pressurization is considered, and (2) permits cannot be granted on a single-site basis alone because the near- and far-field hydrogeologic response may be affected by interference between individual storage sites. We also discuss some of the challenges in making reliable predictions of large-scale hydrogeologic impacts related to CO2 sequestration projects.},

	abstract = {Recently, the oil and gas industry started to experience a major evolution that could impact the geophysical community for decades. The effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more renewable energy and less fossil fuel consumption. In parallel, the carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) business is expected to develop rapidly. However, reliably injecting massive amounts of CO2 underground is more challenging than producing hydrocarbons from a known reservoir. Site integrity monitoring and CO2 leak detection are among the biggest challenges. Capabilities to address these challenges will be requested by regulators and the public for acceptance. This surveillance requires technologies such as microseismic monitoring either from the surface or borehole. Each CCUS project will need a preinjection feasibility study in order to design the best sensor network architecture and to set performance expectancies. Acquisition will be performed over long periods of time. Data harvesting and processing will be performed permanently in automated workflows. For these objectives, site operators must demonstrate their expertise through permanent benchmarks based on a common modeling and simulating platform. Microseismic monitoring is not fully mature and presents additional unsolved challenges for large-scale projects such as CCUS. Using a common and public geologic model to generate synthetic data is a solution to gain more credibility. Limitations can be mitigated after analyzing and quantifying gaps such as localization uncertainties. The model is complex due to the nature of CO2 injection and will evolve over time. A public consortium, such as the SEG Advanced Modeling (SEAM) Corporation, that gathers expertise to generate a common model and synthetic data sets will give the credibility and openness necessary to progress in scientific knowledge. It will also provide the necessary transparency for regulatory approval and public acceptance. A new common CCUS modeling platform offers opportunities to work more efficiently within different disciplines.},

One of the critical elements of the safekeeping of CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} is the sealing capacity of the caprock overlying the storage formation despite faults and/or fractures, which may occur in it. In this work, we present an ongoing injection experiment performed in a fault hosted in clay at the Mont Terri underground rock laboratory (NW Switzerland). The experiment aims to improve our understanding of the main physical and chemical mechanisms controlling (i) the migration of CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} through a fault damage zone, (ii) the interaction of the CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} with the neighboring intact rock, and (iii) the impact of the injection on the transmissivity in the fault. To this end, we inject CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}-saturated saline water in the top of a 3 m thick fault in the Opalinus Clay, a clay formation that is a good analog of common caprock for CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} storage at depth. The mobility of the CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} within the fault is studied at the decameter scale by using a comprehensive monitoring system. Our experiment aims to close the knowledge gap between laboratory and reservoir scales. Therefore, an important aspect of the experiment is the decameter scale and the prolonged duration of observations over many months. We collect observations and data from a wide range of monitoring systems, such as a seismic network, pressure temperature and electrical conductivity sensors, fiber optics, extensometers, and an in situ mass spectrometer for dissolved gas monitoring. The observations are complemented by laboratory data on collected fluids and rock samples. Here we show the details of the experimental concept and installed instrumentation, as well as the first results of the preliminary characterization. An analysis of borehole logging allows for identifying potential hydraulic transmissive structures within the fault zone. A preliminary analysis of the injection tests helped estimate the transmissivity of such structures within the fault zone and the pressure required to mechanically open such features. The preliminary tests did not record any induced microseismic events. Active seismic tomography enabled sharp imaging the fault zone.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We describe a novel framework for estimating subsurface properties, such as rock permeability and porosity, from time-lapse observed seismic data by coupling full-waveform inversion (FWI), subsurface flow processes, and rock physics models. For the inverse modeling, we handle the back propagation of gradients by an intrusive automatic differentiation strategy that offers three levels of user control: (1) At the wave physics level, we adopted the discrete adjoint method in order to use our existing high-performance FWI code; (2) at the rock physics level, we used built-in automatic differentiation operators from the TensorFlow backend; (3) at the flow physics level, we implemented customized partial differential equation (PDE) operators for the multiphase flow equations. The three-level coupled inversion strategy strikes a good balance between computational efficiency and programming efforts, and when the gradients are chained together, it constitutes a coupled inverse system. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the three-level coupled inverse problem is superior in terms of accuracy to a traditional decoupled inversion strategy. Additionally, our method is able to simultaneously invert for parameters in empirical relationships such as the rock physics models. Our proposed inverted model can be used for reservoir performance prediction and reservoir management/optimization purposes.},

	abstract = {A simple theory is developed which yields the approximate stresses within a granular material or powder flowing in hopper systems and gives the critical factors which ensure continued gravity flow. The stress fields during mass flow have been derived by consideration of the forces acting on elemental slices which are simultaneously yielding within themselves and along the hopper walls. Like Jenike, who has given an exact stress solution for hopper outlets only, when considering arching it is assumed that the powder strength is a function only of the local stresses that prevailed during the preceeding flow. Allowance has now been made, however, for the effect of the limited vertical shear stress that can be developed near a steep smooth wall on potential arch span. Consequently, the ideal hopper, designed from the material strength—stress characteristics is likely to have steep smooth walls which get steeper towards the outlet.
Résumé
L'auteur développe une théorie simple analysant les forces approximatives auxquelles sont soumis les matériaux granuleux ou les poudres s'écoulant dans une trêmie. Celle-ci permet de connaître les facteurs critiques assurant un écoulement gravitique continu. Le champ de force naissant lors de l'écoulement massique, a été dérivé en considérant les forces agissant sur les couches élémentaires produites simultanément à l'intérieur de lécoulement et sur les parois du système. De même que Jenike, qui n'a trouvé de solution exacte qu'au problème de la force des sorties, quand on considère la partie inférieure, on suppose que la force s'exerçant sur la poudre n'est fonction que des forces locales, prépondérantes lors de l'écoulement. Il a cependant été tenu compte de la tension de surface verticale qui peut se développer à proximité d'une paroi inclinée lisse. En conséquence la solution idéale pour ces systèmes, solution déduite des caractéristiques dynamiques des matériaux est certainement de disposer des parois inclinées dont l'incinaison s'accentue au fur et à mesure que l'on s'approche de la sortie.
Zusammenfassung
Eine einfache Theorie wird entwickelt, wonach Richtwerte für die Spannungen innerhalb eines granularen Materials oder Pulver, das in Fülltrichtersystemen fliesst, sowie kritische Faktoren zur Sicherung kontinuierlicher Fallströmung, erhalten werden. Die Spannungsfelder während der Messenströmung wurden unter Berücksichtigung der Kräfte erhalten, die auf die Elementarteilchen einwirken, welche gleichzeitig unter sich selbst und entlang der Fülltrichterwände nachgeben. In übereinstimmung mit Jenike, der eine genaue Lösung der Spannungsprobleme einzig für die Fülltrichterausgänge gegeben hat, wird bei der Betrachtung der Verspannung angenommen, dass die Pulverstärke nur von den örtlichen Spannungen, die während der vorausgehenden Strömung vorherrschten, bestimmt wird. Nun wurde aber auch die Wirkung der begrenzten Vertikalschubspannung, die in der Nähe einer steilen, glatten Wand auftreten kann, auf die potentielle Verspannungsweite in Betracht gezogen. Demzufolge wird der ideale Fülltrichter, der auf Grund der Charakteristiken von Materialstärke und Spannungen ausgelegt worden ist, wahrscheinlich steile, glatte Wände, die nach dem Ausgang hin steiler werden, aufweisen.},

The speedup to the CPU version of MFiX-DEM is about 130–243 folds in the simulation of particle packings. In fluidized bed simulations, the DEM computation time is reduced from 91\% to 17\% with a speedup of 78 folds. The simulation of Geldart A particle fluidization revealed a similar level of importance of both fluid and particle coarse-graining. The filtered drag derived from the two-fluid model is suitable for Euler-Lagrangian simulations with both fluid and particle coarse-graining. It overcorrects the influence of sub-grid structures if used for simulations with only fluid coarse-graining.},

However, near the wall, most of the temperature gradient exists in a thin thermal boundary layer, which is typically smaller than the grid size in the computational fluid dynamics method (CFD). This makes it hard to resolve the temperature distribution near the wall in coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM). To obtain a better understanding of the heat transfer mechanism near the confining walls in fluidized beds, we adopted two approaches, i.e., by imposing a thermal boundary condition for the gas phase energy equation and by implementing a particle–wall conduction model for the discrete particle phase. Both methods were first explained in detail and then validated by available experimental results. Finally, the two approaches were compared with respect to their performance on the prediction of the overall particle temperature distribution, parameter sensitivity, and mesh resolution.},

Five common gas-solid drag models are compared, while the contact model is fixed. The predictions are generally in good agreement with the experiments covering fluidization gas velocities from 2umf to 4umf (minimum fluidization velocity), but an overprediction is observed for the particle velocity fluctuations and time-averaged horizontal particle velocity. The properties which are accurately predicted include: the mean and fluctuation frequency of the bed pressure drop, umf, and the time-averaged vertical particle velocity. The predictions of the bubble size and rise velocity agree generally with the correlations in literature. The predictions of the fluctuations of the vertical and horizontal particle velocities, and the particle granular temperature, are somewhat larger than the experiments. The time-averaged horizontal particle velocity is also overpredicted, especially for conditions at 2umf and 3umf.

	abstract = {Gas-solid fluidized beds play an important role in many industrial operations. However, there still is a lack of knowledge concerning the processes inside the bed, which impedes proper designing and upscaling of fluidized bed reactors. In this work, biomass steam gasification in a fluidized bed reactor is investigated with a coarse-grained CFD-DEM approach. The numerical model in the Eulerian-Lagrangian framework treats the gas phase as a continuum and describes the particle interactions with the discrete element method (DEM). The non-spherical shape of the particles is accounted for in the momentum exchange calculation with the gas phase. The considered systems consist of steam as the fluidization gas, entering the bottom region of the three dimensional reactor geometry through inclined nozzles in an inner duct at the center axis. The wood pellets are fed into the reactor from the top of the freeboard together with a nitrogen purge gas stream. Over time, different operation modes occur, since there is no solids removal from the gasifier and unconverted material is continuously added to the bed. Three different operation modes are investigated. For the start-up procedure, the reactor is filled with 2.565 kg of sand particles. The inert material is allowed to settle for three seconds and is fluidized for another three seconds until quasi steady-state is achieved. Afterwards, the wood pellets are added for 35 s at a rate of one pellet every two seconds and undergo the processes of heating, drying, pyrolysis and char conversion. From the simulation results and literature correlations, the average time intervals for pyrolysis and char conversion, as well as the respective particle properties (temperature, diameter, density) are estimated. With the knowledge of the average composition of reactive material in the reactor, variable operating points can be simulated. The other two cases investigated are after approximately 20 and 50 h of operating time. Additionally to the start-up procedure, 0.6 and 1.5 kg of inert residue are added to the sand particles. Again, the inert material is allowed to settle for three seconds and is fluidized for another three seconds. Subsequently, the average reactive material obtained from the start-up simulations is patched into the fluidized bed and wood pellets are fed to the freeboard. The following phenomena are implemented in the numerical model: gas-solid momentum exchange, solids collisional behavior, heat and mass transfer, particle shrinkage and change in material properties, pyrolysis, as well as homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions. Simulation results are analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The particle flow fields and the mixing between sand, residue, and wood are investigated for different fillings of the reactor. Bed pressure drop, product gas composition, and temperature are compared to experimental data in order to validate the numerical model. The results show, that the bed pressure drop, the gas composition, and the conversion time obtained with the numerical simulation agree well with experimental observations and literature correlations. This indicates that the proposed model can make a significant contribution towards understanding and improving the internal processes in fluidized bed reactors for biomass gasification and combustion.},

In DEM, the individual interaction forces between particles are treated on a particle–particle pair basis, and therefore, this method is computational expensive. In addition, the CFD-calculation of the fluid flow increases the computational effort. Thus, current CFD–DEM simulations are limited to systems with particle numbers not exceeding 105. In order to simulate realistic systems, the recently available Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) technology can be applied, which can perform massively-parallel DEM-simulations with several million particles on a single desk-side Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The objective of this work is to present a new hybrid approach to solve CFD–DEM problems in gas–solid fluidized beds systems applying an efficient coupling method suitable for large-scale simulations. We are using the CUDA technology for the particle simulation and introducing a coupling methodology with a commercial CFD-code. The coupling method between a CFD-code, running on the CPU and our CUDA-based DEM-code running on the GPU, is introduced and discussed. The numerical results are compared to the CFD–DEM and the experimental results of Van Buijtenen et al. (2011). A good agreement was achieved. Finally, fluidized system simulations with up to 25 million particles are presented, which is an unprecented number.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive CFD–DEM numerical model has been developed to simulate the biomass gasification process in a fluidized bed reactor. The methodology is based on an Eulerian–Lagrangian concept, which uses an Eulerian method for gas phase and a discrete element method (DEM) for particle phase. Each particle is individually tracked and associated with multiple physical (size, density, composition, and temperature) and thermo-chemical (reactive or inert) properties. Particle collisions, hydrodynamics of dense gas-particle flow in fluidized beds, turbulence, heat and mass transfer, radiation, particle shrinkage, pyrolysis, and homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions are all considered during biomass gasification with steam. A sensitivity analysis is performed to test the integrated model׳s response to variations in three different operating parameters (reactor temperature, steam/biomass mass ratio, and biomass injection position). Simulation results are analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of particle flow pattern, particle mixing and entrainment, bed pressure drop, product gas composition, and carbon conversion. Results show that higher temperatures are favorable for the products in endothermic reactions (e.g. H2 and CO). With the increase of steam/biomass mass ratio, H2 and CO2 concentrations increase while CO concentration decreases. The carbon conversion decreases as the height of injection point increases owing to both an increase of solid entrainment and a decrease of particle residence time and particle temperature. Meanwhile, the calculated results compare well with the experimental data available in the literature. This indicates that the proposed CFD–DEM model and simulations are successful and it can play an important role in the multi-scale modeling of biomass gasification or combustion in fluidized bed reactor.},

Moreover, the model is further validated in a pseudo-2D bubbling fluidized bed and the influence of operating parameters (i.e., fluid velocity, particle diameter, and mass loading) on heat transfer contribution is deeply revealed. The results show that the fluid velocity and particle diameter have a more remarkable influence on convective heat transfer than conductive heat transfer. Besides, the particle-fluid convection dominates the heat transfer while the particle-particle conduction is almost negligible. The particle-fluid-particle conduction occupies about 10\% of the total heat transfer. Finally, the model is successfully applied in a circulating fluidized bed. The average mass fractions of solid materials in the riser, cyclone, and dipleg are 0.737, 0.023, and 0.240, respectively. Solid internal circulations and lower solid velocities in the horizontal part of dipleg lead to a two-peak histogram distribution of particles temperature in the riser and the system.},

These sub-models are coupled with MFiX multi-scale CFD solvers: (1) coupling corrected 0-D intra-particle model with MFiX-CGP (coarse grained particle); (2) coupling 1-D intra-particle model with MFiX-PIC (particle in cell); (3) coupling 1-D intra-particle model with Superquadrics MFiX-DEM (discrete element model); (4) coupling 3-D intra-particle model with glued spheres MFiX-DEM. These solvers are validated against experiments and used in the simulation of pyrolysis reactors processing varied feedstocks.},

	abstract = {Boiling heat transfer occurs in many situations and can be used for thermal management in various engineered systems with high energy density, from power electronics to heat exchangers in power plants and nuclear reactors. Essentially, boiling is a complex physical process that involves interactions between heating surface, liquid, and vapor. For engineering applications, the boiling heat transfer is usually predicted by empirical correlations or semi-empirical models, which has relatively large uncertainty. In this paper, a data-driven approach based on deep feedforward neural networks is studied. The proposed networks use near wall local features to predict the boiling heat transfer. The inputs of networks include the local momentum and energy convective transport, pressure gradients, turbulent viscosity, and surface information. The outputs of the networks are the quantities of interest of a typical boiling system, including heat transfer components, wall superheat, and near wall void fraction. The networks are trained by the high-fidelity data processed from first principle simulation of pool boiling under varying input heat fluxes. State-of-the-art algorithms are applied to prevent the overfitting issue when training the deep networks. The trained networks are tested in interpolation cases and extrapolation cases which both demonstrate good agreement with the original high-fidelity simulation results.},

In this research, the effects of these multi-scale phenomena are captured using a glued-sphere computational fluid dynamic discrete element method (CFD-DEM) with 3-D intra-particle models. The glued-spheres resolved the shapes of particles and intra-particle temperature and species distributions. The implementation was validated using the pyrolysis data of a spherical particle and a cylindrical particle. Then, the influences of biomass shapes and sizes on pyrolysis were investigated. The results revealed the significant influence of surface areas and mass distributions on interphase heat transfer and chemical reactions. The intra-particle heat transfer is neglectable for a Biot number smaller than 0.41. Finally, the pyrolysis of irregularly shaped biomass particles in a fixed bed, fluidized bed, and spouted bed was simulated. Analysis of conversion distributions showed the largest deviations in the fixed bed and the slowest conversion rate in the spouted bed. A good balance between uniform and fast conversion is achieved in the fluidized bed. The multi-scale method proposed in this research provides a tool for the evaluation of large irregular-shaped biomass particle pyrolysis in different types of reactors.},

A considerable amount of the literature uses lumped kinetic approaches to predict pyrolysis products. Despite the prolonged studies, the science of pyrolysis chemistry and models’ capability to simulate the exact conversion phenomenon has unraveled yet. In this review, an initiative was made by compiling existing mathematical models for biomass pyrolysis viz., lumped and distributed kinetic models, particle, and reactor models. An absolute analysis of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), artificial neural network (ANN), and ASPEN Plus models was also conducted. It was observed that the coupling of distributed kinetic models with CFD provides a better understanding of the hydrodynamic reaction of particles under reactive flow with the influence on reactor performance and predicts exact product yield. Furthermore, the pros and cons of each modeling technique are also highlighted individually. Finally, considering the future perspective of biomass pyrolysis with respect to the modeling approach, suggestions have been incorporated.},

Furthermore, a series of flux maps was modeled with soltrace® to compare the experimental data with the theoretically derived counterparts. The solar simulator produced a peak solar intensity of over 700 suns in a 10 mm diameter area. The temporal variance for flux is within ±5\%. A condensing system which can separate the liquid products at four different temperatures was also designed and constructed. The optimum temperature for maximum bio-oil production was 750 °C measured at the front of the reactor under direct irradiation of solar light. The produced bio-oil, bio-char and gases were analyzed with different instruments such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography (micro-GC), and mass spectroscopy (GC–MS). The effects of solar light intensities on bio-oil composition were studied. Also, solar based pyrolysis was compared with conventional thermal based biomass pyrolysis.

	abstract = {Dense granular flows exist in many solid particle heat exchangers and solar receivers studied in the field of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP). By tracking particles individually with the Discrete Element Method (DEM), the details of particle friction, collisions, and mixing can be modeled accurately. An open source DEM-based code for modeling heat transfer in dense granular flows is presented, called Dense Particle Heat Transfer (DPHT). It uses one-way coupling, with DEM run first to find the particle positions and DPHT run second to calculate heat transfer between particles and any walls. Heat transfer is computed with six sub-models, including effects from contact conduction, conduction through the thin fluid gap between particles, and thermal radiation. Simulations are run to investigate particle-particle radiation, with DPHT matching a full Monte Carlo ray tracing simulation to within 1.6\%, whereas the “local environment temperature” models from literature show physically unrealistic results. As a test of the accuracy of DPHT, a simulation is run to replicate published experimental work, and results in terms of total heat transfer are within 4\%. Finally, a tubular heat exchanger is analyzed, and a “radial” mixer design is introduced, increasing heat transfer by 8\%. Several DEM-based heat transfer codes have been described in literature, but they are often kept in-house. Some open source codes exist as well, but they generally have drawbacks including missing heat transfer modes, insufficient flexibility to make significant changes, and incomplete documentation. DPHT aims to simplify this modeling method by providing a flexible, open source solution.},

	abstract = {Biomass as a form of energy source may be utilized in two different ways: directly by burning the biomass and indirectly by converting it into solid, liquid or gaseous fuels. Pyrolysis is an indirect conversion method, and can be described in simpler terms as a thermal decomposition of biomass under oxygen-depleted conditions to an array of solid, liquid and gaseous products, namely biochar, bio-oil and fuel gas. However, pyrolysis of biomass is a complex chemical process with several operational and environmental challenges. Consequently, this process has been widely investigated in order to understand the mechanisms and kinetics of pyrolysis at different scales, viz. particle level, multi-phase reacting flow, product distribution and reactor performance, process integration and control. However, there are a number of uncertainties in current biomass pyrolysis models, especially in their ability to optimize process conditions to achieve desired product yields and distribution. The present contribution provides a critical review of the current status of mathematical modelling studies of biomass pyrolysis with the aim to identify knowledge gaps for further research and opportunities for integration of biomass pyrolysis models of disparate scales. Models for the hydrodynamic behaviour of particles in pyrolysis, and their interaction with the reactive flow and the effect on the performance of the reactors have also been critically analyzed. From this analysis it becomes apparent that feedstock characteristics, evolving physical and chemical properties of biomass particles and residence times of both solid and gas phases in reactors hold the key to the desired performance of the pyrolysis process. Finally, the importance of catalytic effects in pyrolysis has also been critically analyzed, resulting in recommendations for further research in this area especially on selection of catalysts for optimal product yields under varying operating conditions.},

However, most recent reports have focused on calibration for real particles of idealized shape (e.g., spherical) or large size (e.g., {\textgreater}1 mm), presented complex calibration procedures that may be difficult to adopt in an industrial setting, lack documented experimental validation of the approach, or apply to only a specific material of interest. In this article, we present an industrial perspective on application of DEM models centered on a generalized calibration approach for fine powders with low-to-moderate cohesion that is simple, rapid, and requires minimal experimentation. The approach, based on previous work, is formalized here and utilizes non-rotating spherical parcels to represent a small volume of powder, and in many cases, the simulation results are reasonably predictive of bulk powder flow behavior in dense systems. The assumptions and limitations of the approach, along with some guidelines for application are discussed. Finally, several examples from the literature demonstrating success of the approach in industrially-relevant powder processes with comparison to either commonly accepted theory or experimental data are presented.},

Parametrisation is typically carried out manually and requires experimental data for each powder considered. This becomes cumbersome when considering different ratios of component powders. An automated parameterisation workflow was developed and validated using experimental powder mixtures of micro-crystalline cellulose and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate. FEM simulations reproduced experimental compaction curves with a mean error of 2.5\% of the maximum compaction pressure. Moreover, a mixing methodology was developed to estimate parameters of mixtures using only pure-component parameters as input.

This paper presents a review of the recent efforts in developing DEM approaches to model non-spherical particulate systems (NSPS) and strategies of coupling such a non-spherical DEM model with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for particle-fluid flows. It mainly covers four important aspects: the techniques for representation of non-spherical particles and their contact detection, the models describing inter-particle collision dynamics and fluid-particle forces, CFD-DEM coupling methodologies including averaged volume method and immersed family methods and the applications of the developed theories to the modelling of different NSPS.

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates a deep neural network approach for predicting carbon dioxide (CO2) plume migration from an injection well in heterogeneous formations with high computational efficiency. With the data generation and training procedures proposed in this paper, we show that the deep neural network model can generate predictions of CO2 plume migration that are as accurate as traditional numerical simulation, given input variables of a permeability field, an injection duration, injection rate, and injection location. The neural network model can deal with permeability fields that have high degrees of heterogeneity. Unlike previous studies which did not consider the effect of buoyancy, here we also show that the neural network model can learn the consequences of the interplay of gravity, viscous, and capillary forces, which is critically important for predicting CO2 plume migration. The neural network model has an excellent ability to generalize within the training data ranges and to a limited extent, the ability to extrapolate beyond the training data ranges. To improve the prediction accuracy when the neural network model needs to extrapolate to situations or parameters not contained in the training set, we propose a transfer learning (fine-tuning) procedure that can quickly teach the trained neural network model new information without going through massive data collection and retraining. With the approaches described in this paper, we have demonstrated many of the building blocks required for developing a general-purpose neural network for predicting CO2 plume migration away from an injection well.},

	abstract = {The elastic modulus of soil is a key parameter for geotechnical projects, transportation engineering, engineering geology and geotechnics, but its estimation in laboratory or field is complex and difficult task due to instrument handling problems, high cost, and it being a time consuming process. For this reason, the predictive models are useful tool for indirect estimation of elastic modulus. In this study, to determine the modulus of elasticity of soil, a rapid, less expensive, and reliable predictive model was proposed using artificial neural network (ANN). For this purpose, a series of laboratory tests were conducted to estimate the index properties (i.e., particle size fractions, plastic limit, liquid limit, unit weight, and specific gravity) and the modulus of elasticity of soils collected from Mahabaleshwar (Maharashtra), Malshej Ghat (Maharashtra), and Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh), in India. The input parameters in the developed ANN model are gravel, sand, fines, plastic limit, liquid limit, unit weight, and specific gravity, and the output is modulus of elasticity. The accuracy of the obtained ANN model was also compared with the multiple regression model based on coefficient of determination (R2), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the variance account for (VAF). The ANN predictive model had the R2, MAE, and VAF equal to 0.98, 5.07, and 97.64 \%, respectively, superseding the performance of the multiple regression model. The performance comparison revealed that ANN model has more reliable predictive performance than multiple regression and it can be applied for predicting the modulus of elasticity of soil with more confidence. Thus, the result of the present study indicates that the modulus of elasticity of soil can reliably be estimated from the indirect method using ANN analysis with greater confidence.},

Toward this end, a versatile energy potential function is first presented and examined. It is shown to cover a wide range of existing empirical relations for pressure-dependent stiffness of soils. Utilization of these functions within hyperplastic constitutive framework allows for the resulting models to satisfy the Law of Energy Conservation for both elastic and plastic components of soil behavior. Apart from the theoretical rigor, a very important result of this approach is that it automatically implies stress-induced cross-anisotropy of the elastic component of soil behavior and dilatancy term occurs due to shear modulus dependency on pressure. Proper modeling of these phenomena, normally neglected by conventional hypoelastic-plastic models, has been shown to have a significant effect on the accuracy of the model predictions of undrained behavior of overconsolidated clays both in laboratory tests and in tunnel excavation problem.},

In this paper elasticity models are derived that allow for variation of elastic moduli as power functions of mean stress, while guaranteeing thermodynamic acceptability.

The model employs two material parameters to describe basic volumetric and shear response, one to express nonlinearity of stiffness as a function of mean stress, and two more (together with the directions of the principal axes of anisotropy) to express the degree of anisotropy. The model is modular, so that non-linearity and anisotropy can be included separately or in combination. For specific parameter settings it reduces to simpler cases such as linear isotropic elasticity. Because the model employs hyperelasticity, thermodynamic acceptability is ensured and all appropriate cross-coupling terms are included between the shear and volumetric behaviour.},

	abstract = {A novel weakly compressible multi-phase SPH method is developed for modeling various landslides. In this model, the multi-phase system of fluid and granular materials is regarded as a continuum with multi-viscosity and multi-density. The mechanical behavior of the granular materials is described by the μ(I) rheological model and the dynamic effective pressure. An incremental diffusive term is developed to eliminate the non-physical fluctuation in the pressure field of multi-phase flow. A dynamic calculation method of effective pressure is introduced to overcome the additional calculation and error caused by the traditional method in searching for the phase interface. A friction boundary condition called the momentum method is introduced to consider the influence of basal friction on the evolution of granular landslides. The Particle Shifting Technique (PST) of the single-phase WCSPH is introduced into the multi-phase WCSPH by the two-step shifting procedure to ensure the uniform distribution of particles in each phase and phase interface during the simulation process. The effectiveness of the incremental diffusive term is first validated using a benchmark case of the two phases hydrostatic stratified column. Then the model is applied to the numerical simulation of dry granular landslide, sub-aerial granular landslide, submerged granular landslide, and rigid landslide. The calculated results are compared with experimental results and previous numerical models to verify and evaluate the performance of the current model. Proven that this model is well consistent with experimental results and has higher accuracy than previous numerical models.},

A modified Newton–Raphson stress update algorithm has been adopted for the implementation of the model and it was found that the algorithm׳s convergence performance is sensitive to the expression of the yield function.

	abstract = {The recovery of shale resources will not be commercially successful without the key technologies of long lateral wells and hydraulic fracturing. However, large expense and high volume of water consumed during the operation has become a disadvantageous limit when oil price goes below the primary cost of the stimulation process. The motivation for this study comes from an urgent need of more efficient, cost-effective and environmental friendly methods for shale formation stimulation.  
During the experimental study of Pulsed Power Plasma Stimulation, 2 kJ of electrical energy is stored in capacitor with the discharge voltage sets at 2 kV. A designed system of Exploding Aluminum foil 20"×1" and adaptable electrode is constructed underwater to transfer stored energy into other forms of energy: mechanical energy, electrochemical energy, and electromagnetic energy. The potentials of PPPS technique may be categorized into two parts: a) Mechanically, as an alternative of hydraulic fracturing as a cost-effective and water-saving method for horizontal well stimulation and b) electromagnetically, as an alternative to Microseismic for underground imaging of fracture geometry.  
Current stage of experiments is focusing on single pulse test. The shock wave, whether it is the result of mechanical energy or the electrochemical energy, exerts direct tremendous dynamic load on the test sample, which causes the initiation of multi-fracture system. The dissertation also gives description of all the experimental set-ups of all aspects and the analysis of all collected data including the pressure measurements and multi-fracture system. During the discharge, the electric current going through the foil could be as high as 40 kA. Strong inductive signal is also captured. This provide strong evidence of the strong magnetic field introduced by changing current (dipole). The radiation pattern of the dipole is studied both analytically and numerically.},

Hence, a low permeability rock containing gas trapped into occluded pores can be fragmented with the help of dynamic loads, and gas can be extracted in a much more efficient way compared with hydraulic fracturing, where only large macro cracks are formed with very few connections between occluded pores. At the stage of laboratory development of this technique, compressive underwater shock waves have been used to increase the intrinsic permeability of concrete specimens. In a previous study, pressure waves generated by pulsed arc electrohydraulic discharges in water were used in order to induce micro-cracking and an increase of average permeability of concrete hollow cylinders subjected to confinement stresses (equivalent to geostatic stresses). We discuss here a 3-D anisotropic constitutive model aimed at describing the dynamic response of these specimens. It is based on rate-dependent continuum damage constitutive relations. Crack closure effects and damage-induced anisotropy are included in the model. The directional growth of damage is related to the directional growth of material intrinsic permeability. Numerical simulations of damage induced by shock waves show good agreement with the experiments for various confinement levels of the specimens. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The upstream of bioenergy industry has suffered from unreliable operations of granular biomass feedstocks in handling equipment. Computational modeling, including continuum-mechanics models and discrete-particle models, offers insightful understandings and predictive capabilities on the flow of milled biomass and can assist equipment design and optimization. This paper presents a benchmark study on the fidelity of the continuum and discrete modeling approaches for predicting granular biomass flow. We first introduce the constitutive law of the continuum-mechanics model and the contact law of the coarse-grained discrete-particle model, with model parameters calibrated against laboratory characterization tests of the milled loblolly pine. Three classical granular material flow systems (i.e., a lab-scale rotating drum, a pilot-scale hopper, and a full-scale inclined plane) are then simulated using the two models with the same initial and boundary conditions as the physical experiments. The close agreement of the numerical predictions with the experimental measurements on the hopper mass flow rate, the hopper critical outlet width, the material stopping thickness on the inclined plane, and the dynamic angle of repose, clearly indicates that the two methods can capture the critical flow behavior of granular biomass. The qualitative comparison shows that the continuum-mechanics model outperforms in parameterization of materials and wall friction, and large-scale systems, while the discrete-particle model is more preferred for discontinuous flow systems at smaller scales. Industry stakeholders can use these findings as guidance for choosing appropriate numerical tools to model biomass material flow in part of the optimization of material handling equipment in biorefineries.},

Here, we introduce the basic concepts of mineral carbonation including a brief description of the process routes and pre-treatment techniques. We discuss the scope of integrated mineral carbonation process application, and critically review the integrated mineral carbonation process in the mining industry including modified passive carbonation techniques in tailing storage facilities, and ex-situ carbonation routes using fresh tailings. The focus of the discussions is the role of reaction condition on the carbonation efficiency of mine waste with various mineralogical compositions, and the benefits and drawbacks of each integrated mineral carbonation process. All discussions lead to suggestions for the technological improvement of integrated mineral carbonation. Finally, we review the techno-economic assessments on existing integrated mineral carbonation technologies. Research to date indicates that value-added by-products will play an important role in the commercialization of an integrated mineral carbonation process.},

Using energy consumption information, different sustainability issues can be addressed, such as the relationship with ore grade over the years, energy variations in electricity or fossil fuel use. A rigorous analysis and understanding of the energy intensity use in mining is the first step towards a more sustainable mining industry and, globally, better resource management. Numerous studies have focused on the energy consumption of mining projects, with analysis carried out primarily in one single country or one single region. This paper quantifies, on a global level, the relationship between ore grade and energy intensity. With the case of copper, the study has shown that the average copper ore grade is decreasing over time, while the energy consumption and the total material production in the mine increases. Analyzing only copper mines, the average ore grade has decreased approximately by 25\% in just ten years. In that same period, the total energy consumption has increased at a higher rate than production (46\% energy increase over 30\% production increase).},

	abstract = {The study evaluated implications of different ore grades and mine-depth on the energy inputs to extract and process copper. Based on a 191 value dataset from 28 copper mining operations, seven model equations explaining operational energy costs were statistically evaluated. Energy costs for copper mines with leaching operations were not found to be significantly affected by ore grades nor mine-depth as all tested equations were rejected in the analysis. In case of mines with milling/flotation operations, a significant relation was established (p {\textless} 0.000, R2 = 0.63 for surface mines and R2 = 0.84 for underground mines) which was found to be: energy cost is log-linearly dependent on depth plus the reciprocal of ore grade. On the basis of the equation, an ore grade of 0.5, 0.4 and 0.3\% at 300 m of depth results in an energy cost of 60, 127 and 447 MJ/kg to obtain a 30\%+ copper concentrate from underground mines, and 52, 95 and 255 MJ/kg for surface mines, respectively. Energy costs are found to accelerate significantly below the 0.5\% ore grade level, which can be interpreted as a biophysical barrier below which mining plus milling/flotation becomes increasingly challenging under current efficiency. In splitting out energy use into diesel and electricity, the study found both impacted by decreasing ore grades, but only electricity usage to be substantially influenced by mine-depth. Depth impacts were established as a 7\% increase in electricity costs per 100 m and compounded by ore grades.},

	abstract = {The concept of “peak oil” has been explored and debated extensively within the literature. However there has been comparatively little research examining the concept of “peak minerals”, particularly in-depth analyses for individual metals. This paper presents scenarios for mined copper production based upon a detailed assessment of global copper resources and historic mine production. Scenarios for production from major copper deposit types and from individual countries or regions were developed using the Geologic Resources Supply-Demand Model (GeRS-DeMo). These scenarios were extended using cumulative grade-tonnage data, derived from our resource database, to produce estimates of potential rates of copper ore grade decline. The scenarios indicate that there are sufficient identified copper resources to grow mined copper production for at least the next twenty years. The future rate of ore grade decline may be less than has historically been the case, as mined grades are approaching the average resource grade and there is still significant copper endowment in high grade ore bodies. Despite increasing demand for copper as the developing world experiences economic growth, the economic and environmental impacts associated with increased production rates and declining ore grades (particularly those relating to energy consumption, water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions) will present barriers to the continued expansion of the industry. For these reasons peak mined copper production may well be realised during this century.},

	abstract = {In this work, we explore a novel mineral processing approach using carbon dioxide to promote mineral alterations that lead to improved extractability of nickel from olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4). The precept is that by altering the morphology and the mineralogy of the ore via mineral carbonation, the comminution requirements and the acid consumption during hydrometallurgical processing can be reduced. Furthermore, carbonation pre-treatment can lead to mineral liberation and concentration of metals in physically separable phases.  In a first processing step, olivine is fully carbonated at high CO2 partial pressures (35 bar) and optimal temperature (200 °C) with the addition of pH buffering agents. This leads to a powdery product containing high carbonate content. The main products of the carbonation reaction include quasi-amorphous colloidal silica, chromium-rich metallic particles, and ferro-magnesite ((Mg1−x,Fex)CO3). Carbonated olivine was subsequently leached using an array of inorganic and organic acids to test their leaching efficiency. Compared to leaching from untreated olivine, the percentage of nickel extracted from carbonated olivine by acid leaching was significantly increased. It is anticipated that the mineral carbonation  pre-treatment approach may also be applicable to other ultrabasic and lateritic ores.},

These challenges can be met in one process whereby CO2 mineralization can be utilized for simultaneous mineral carbonation to stabilize CO2 gas and concurrent nickel sulfidization. The newly formed nickel sulfide may be recovered by conventional means to enhance industrial nickel supply. Mineral carbonation provides the pre-condition for nickel sulfidization to release nickel into aqueous solution from the crystal structure of olivine as a secondary nickel resource. The released nickel ions can be converted to nickel sulfide for further recovery while other bivalent metal ions such as Mg2+ can concurrently react with CO2 to form stable carbonates. The continuous supply of sulfide ions and CO2 is important to achieve selective nickel conversion and mineral carbonation. A mixed gas containing 5\% H2S – 95\% CO2 can accelerate mineral carbonation and form nickel sulfide.},

	abstract = {In 2013, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory led a geologic carbon sequestration field demonstration where ∼1000 tonnes of CO2 was injected into several deep Columbia River Basalt zones near Wallula, Washington. Rock core samples extracted from the injection zone two years after CO2 injection revealed nascent carbonate mineralization that was qualitatively consistent with expectations from laboratory experiments and reactive transport modeling. Here, we report on a new detailed analysis of the 2012 pre-injection and 2015 post-injection hydrologic tests that capitalizes on the difference in fluid properties between scCO2 and water to assess changes in near-field, wellbore, and reservoir conditions that are apparent approximately two years following the end of injection. This comparative hydrologic test analysis method provides a new way to quantify the amount of injected CO2 that was mineralized in the field test. Modeling results indicate that approximately 60\% of the injected CO2 was sequestered via mineralization within two years, with the resulting carbonates occupying ∼4\% of the available reservoir pore space. The method presented here provides a new monitoring tool to assess the fate of CO2 injected into chemically reactive basalt formations but could also be adapted for long-term monitoring and verification within more traditional subsurface carbon storage reservoirs.},

The test results demonstrated that atmospheric CO2 dissolution induced the weathering of serpentine and brucite within the ultramafic rocks, generating high concentrations of Mg and HCO3− with pH values ranging between 9 and 10 in the leachates that promote the precipitation of secondary Mg carbonates. These alkaline pH values appear to have prevented the mobilization of many metals; Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn were found at negligible concentrations in the leachates. Posttesting characterization using chemical analyses, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations confirmed the precipitation of secondary hydrated Mg carbonates as predicted by thermodynamic calculations.

	abstract = {A conceptual Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) model, where water is circulated through a pair of parallel injection and production wells connected by a set of single large wing fractures, is designed, modeled, and evaluated in this work. The water circulation and heat extraction in the fractured reservoirs is modeled as a fully coupled process of fluid flow and heat transport. Using a newly developed, open-source, finite element based geothermal simulation code, FALCON, simulation results were obtained for a 30-year operation at a depth of 3 km and geothermal gradient of 65°C per km of depth. With a sensitivity study of the heat production to the design parameters, preferable fracture horizontal spacing, downward deviation angle of the parallel wells, and injection flow rate are recommended. Upscaling calculations of the developed EGS model have shown that, an industrial production-level system may be achievable if it consists of 40 equidistant fractures that connect two 1.2 km long parallel well sections with a well separation of 500 m; and if a system of these dimensions operates for 30 years at a flow rate of 0.1 m3/s, with an electric power output at least 5 MW and pumping power of less than 1 MW. In particular, the performance metrics demonstrated in this work match well with those suggested by others, thus indicating the general applicability of our conceptual models.},

The downhole collocated arrays are part of the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) geothermal experiment, in which stimulation of the rock volume in an enhanced geothermal system (EGS) causes microseismic events. The DAS acquisition system yields data sampled at every 1 m at 2000 samples per second for the entire length of the well, spanning to a depth of 985 m from the surface. Whereas single DAS channels are substantially noisier than geophones at the same location, their large number and spatial coherency allow for the application of effective array processing techniques. We follow a complete workflow for the fiber‐optic array: velocity model building, event detection, event location, and magnitude estimation. Estimated velocity models agree well with sonic logging in a nearby well and map a granitic contact accurately. Detection performance is somewhat worse than geophones and yields magnitude completeness of −1.4 compared to −1.7 for geophones. Using a single vertical fiber array, we cannot retrieve the azimuth of the events relative to the well. However, we can very accurately estimate their depth and horizontal distance from the array. Magnitude estimation with DAS approaches geophone results to within a standard deviation of M=0.115 and negligible mean difference. The DAS processing results outperform a regional and local surface array, consolidated with a shallow borehole sensor. Although downhole geophones in the FORGE experimental layout performed better, DAS holds several critical practical benefits that were not demonstrated. Thanks to its heat resistance, it can be deployed much closer to the reservoir; fibers can be deployed along cased active wells, eliminating the need for a dedicated monitoring well; the permanently installed fiber can be used for years or decades. Therefore, we argue that DAS holds vast potential for long‐term monitoring of EGS projects.},

	abstract = {Predicting gas production from stimulated unconventional reservoirs has always been a challenge to oil and gas companies because the physics of fluid flow through such reservoirs is not well understood. On the other hand, modeling gas production from shale reservoirs is a complex multi-variate problem that requires proper integration of data from multiple disciplines, such as geology, petrophysics, geomechanics, completions, and surface-based measurements, etc. This study demonstrates the application of data-driven machine learning algorithms, integrating geoscientific, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), distributed temperature sensing (DTS) fiber-optic, completions, flow scanner production log, and surface data to model daily gas production from a 28-stage stimulated horizontal well drilled in the Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian basin in North America. In addition, this study aims to utilize the data from a fiber-optic monitoring system, such as DAS and DTS to evaluate the well performance. We build supervised data-driven machine learning models using Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to understand the well performance and forecast the daily gas production. The study compares the forecasted results, tests the level of accuracy, and addresses different issues with these machine learning algorithms. A spatio-temporal database is constructed and used to perform sensitivity analyses to identify the key drivers for gas production. The results show that RF and ANN algorithms can be used to predict daily gas production with significantly high accuracy; however, RF algorithm is the best predictor in terms of highest accuracy (96\%), less computational time and cost. Based on sensitivity analysis, it appears that Poisson's ratio, minimum horizontal stress, DAS, casing pressure, gamma log are the most important parameters to predict gas production.},

Therefore, visual observation of the fracturing behavior can be useful information for understanding dynamic fracturing and crack propagation process under blasting loading. In this study, dynamic fracturing behavior under blasting loading was investigated through experimental and numerical methods. Transparent and homogeneous PMMA was used for specimen, while DDNP(diazodinitrophenol) detonators were used to apply blasting loadings. During the blasting experiment, fracturing and crack propagation process were observed using a high-speed camera, then the crack propagation behavior was analyzed in both quantitative and qualitative manners. The results showed that gas-driven fracture in an ear-shape was more predominant than shock-wave-driven fractures. Further, the extent of crack propagation significantly depended on the amount of explosives charge. The experimental results matched well with the analytical solution based on the fracture mechanics theories. A numerical simulation was carried out using a commercial FEM software, which is capable of solving non-linear dynamic problems. The numerical simulation reasonably reproduced the cracking behavior in terms of crack length and orientation which were observed in the experiment.},

	abstract = {Artificial fracture stimulation in host-rock using soundless cracking demolition agents (SCDAs) is a potential alternative for rock fragmentation in enhanced in-situ leaching applications of mineral ores because conventional mining techniques are becoming increasingly uneconomic with declining ore-grade. In this study we investigated the impact of different injection well patterns on the fracture network propagation of an SCDA charged rock mass using a discrete element numerical simulation. First, a laboratory scale fracturing experiment was conducted on a simple specimen having two injection wells filled with SCDA. The results of the experiment were used to validate the numerical simulation, and the model was then extended to assess the SCDA charged fracture propagation in a host-rock formation with different injection well patterns typically found in the field. A two-staged fracturing process was identified from the numerical simulation observations and was defined as pre-fracture coalescence and post-fracture coalescence stages. The expansive pressure development within injection wells from the SCDA charging and the corresponding fracture growth was found to be dependent on the number of injection wells surrounding a centre injection well. With the increasing number of injection wells, the fracture connectivity between wells was found to decrease and consequentially a diminishing return of fracture density was observed. This is a result of the larger compressive stress fields generated within the rock mass with the increasing number of SCDA injection wells. The optimum number of injection wells surrounding a centre injection well was found to be four or five (five or six injection well pattern), which produces the highest fracture connectivity and the fracture density for enhanced ISL applications.},

	abstract = {Low-frequency distributed-acoustic-sensing (LF-DAS) strain data are direct measurements of in-situ rock deformation during hydraulic-fracturing treatments. In addition to monitoring fracture propagation and identifying fracture hits, quantitative strain measurements of LF-DAS provide opportunities to quantify fracture geometries. Recently, we proposed a Green’s function–based algorithm for the inversion of LF-DAS strain data (Liu et al. 2020b) that shows an accurate estimation of fracture width near the monitor well with single-cluster completions. However, multicluster completions with tighter cluster spacings are more commonly adopted in recent completion designs. One main challenge in the inversion of LF-DAS strain data under such circumstances is that strain measurements at fracture-hit locations by LF-DAS are not reliable, which makes the individual contribution of each fracture to the measured strain data indistinguishable.In this study, we first extended the inversion algorithm to handle multiple fractures, investigated the uncertainties of the inversion results, and proposed possible mitigation to the challenges raised by completion designs and field data acquisition through a synthetic case study. Ideally, there are available data on both sides of each fracture so that the inverted width of each fracture can be obtained with a negligible error. In reality, the strain data are usually limited, providing less constraint on the width of individual fracture. Nevertheless, the inversion results provide an accurate estimation of the width summation of all fractures. To evaluate the individual fracture width, a time-dependent constraint is added to the inversion algorithm. We assume that the width at the current timestep is dependent on the width at the previous step and the width variation between the two timesteps. The width variation can be roughly estimated from LF-DAS strain-rate data at the fracture-hit location. This extra constraint helps to improve the inversion performance. Finally, a field example is presented. We show the width summation of all fractures and the width of each individual fracture as a function of treatment time. The time-dependent width profiles show consistent trends with the LF-DAS strain-rate data. The calculated strains from the inverted model match well with the LF-DAS measured strain data. The findings demonstrate the potential of LF-DAS data for quantitative hydraulic-fracture characterization and provide insights on better use of LF-DAS data. The direct information on fracture width helps to calibrate fracturing models and optimize the completion designs.},

We demonstrate a novel application of a fiber-optic-based distributed strain sensing (DSS) technology to measure and characterize near-wellbore fractures and perforation cluster efficiency during production. Distributed fiber-optic-based strain measurements are made based on the frequency shift of the Rayleigh scatter spectrum, which is linearly dependent on strain and temperature changes of the sensing fiber. Strain changes along the wellbore are continuously measured during the shut-in and reopening operations of a well. After removing temperature effects, extensional strain changes can be observed at locations around the perforation cluster during a shut-in period. We interpret that the observed strain changes are caused by near-wellbore fracture aperture changes caused by pressure increases within the near-wellbore fracture network. The depth locations of the measured strain changes correlate well with distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) acoustic intensity measurements that were measured during the stimulation of the well. The shape and magnitude of the strain changes differ significantly between two completion designs in the same well. Different dependencies between strain and borehole pressure can be observed at most of the perforation clusters between the shut-in and reopening periods. We assess that this new type of distributed fiber-optic measurement method can significantly improve understanding of near-wellbore hydraulic fracture characteristics and the relationships between stimulation and production from unconventional oil and gas wells.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method to monitor caprock and wellbore integrity at CO2 storage sites by utilizing the Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS). DFOS has an advantage to measure temperature and strain at any point in an unprocessed optical fiber, contrary to the conventional Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensing which measures temperature and strain at a limited number of discrete points along the processed fiber cable. To put the DFOS technique into the practical use at the CO2 storage sites, we measured the frequency shifts of the Rayleigh and Brillouin scattering in an optical fiber attached to a sandstone sample under hydrostatic pressure, and also measured strain of the sample by conventional strain gages simultaneously. We applied the DFOS technique to our filed experiments when injecting and extracting fluid from a shallow well. The shallow well was drilled to a depth of 300m and three optical fiber cables were installed behind well casing for detecting impacted zones along the well depth direction. With this permanent installation behind casing, we successfully detected the deformed zone during the fluid injection and extraction tests. The field results suggest that the DFOS technique can be used in geomechanical monitoring of caprock and wellbore integrity by providing deformation details such as which depth and how much the target layer deformed in subsurface.},

	abstract = {Sandstone uranium deposits represent uranium concentrations formed by low-temperature hydrothermal processes, usually of diagenetic to epigenetic origin. The deposits are commonly hosted in arkosic sandstone and are therefore referred to as sandstone-type uranium. Globally, this is the most abundant type of uranium mineralisation, containing approximately 28\% of the world’s uranium resources and including several giant deposits with resources exceeding 100 kt of uranium. The main uranium minerals are pitchblende and coffinite, and uranium is recovered from host rocks by conventional hydrometallurgical technologies using sulphuric acid or alkaline leach. Host sediments were deposited in many different geological environments including continental intracratonic basins, intermontane depressions, coastal-plains and palaeo-river channels. Mineralisation is mostly stratabound and localised in the permeable sandstone at the redox interfaces where oxidised uranium-rich fluids have intersected with relatively reduced basin lithologies. Sandstone-type uranium mineralisation can also be distributed along permeable fault zones cutting sedimentary sequences. Deposits are subdivided into four groups: roll front (roll-type), tabular, basal channel and tectonic-lithologic types. Many sandstone uranium deposits cannot be exploited by conventional mining technologies because of low grade and difficult geotechnical conditions created by the presence of poorly consolidated wallrocks and the location of ore bodies below the water table. However, because of high permeability of the host sediments and the favourable uranium mineralogy, these deposits are well-suited to exploitation by in situ leach (ISL) technique. ISL mining is defined as the process of uranium extraction from the host sandstone in situ by injecting the chemical leach solutions directly into the ore zone. The pregnant solutions containing leached uranium are transported to the surface through production wells. Uranium is recovered from the solutions to produce yellowcake.},

	abstract = {We performed flow-through laboratory experiments on five cylindrically cored samples of ultramafic rocks, in which we generated a well-mated through-going tensile fracture, to investigate evolution of fracture permeability during serpentinization. The samples were tested in a triaxial loading machine at a confining pressure of 50 MPa, pore pressure of 20 MPa, and temperature of 260°C, simulating a depth of 2 km under hydrostatic conditions. A pore pressure difference of up to 2 MPa was imposed across the ends of the sample. Fracture permeability decreased by 1–2 orders of magnitude during the 200–330 h experiments. Electron microprobe and SEM data indicated the formation of needle-shaped crystals of serpentine composition along the walls of the fracture, and chemical analyses of sampled pore fluids were consistent with dissolution of ferro-magnesian minerals. By comparing the difference between fracture permeability and matrix permeability measured on intact samples of the same rock types, we concluded that the contribution of the low matrix permeability to flow is negligible and essentially all of the flow is focused in the tensile fracture. The experimental results suggest that the fracture network in long-lived hydrothermal circulation systems can be sealed rapidly as a result of mineral precipitation, and generation of new permeability resulting from a combination of tectonic and crystallization-induced stresses is required to maintain fluid circulation.},

	abstract = {The platinum-group elements (PGEs)—platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium—are metals that have similar physical and chemical properties and tend to occur together in nature. PGEs are indispensable to many industrial applications but are mined in only a few places. The availability and accessibility of PGEs could be disrupted by economic, environmental, political, and social events. The United States net import reliance as a percentage of apparent consumption is about 90 percent.PGEs have many industrial applications. They are used in catalytic converters to reduce carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and nitrous oxide emissions in automobile exhaust. The chemical industry requires platinum or platinum-rhodium alloys to manufacture nitric oxide, which is the raw material used to manufacture explosives, fertilizers, and nitric acid. In the petrochemical industry, platinum-supported catalysts are needed to refine crude oil and to produce aromatic compounds and high-octane gasoline. Alloys of PGEs are exceptionally hard and durable, making them the best known coating for industrial crucibles used in the manufacture of chemicals and synthetic materials. PGEs are used by the glass manufacturing industry in the production of fiberglass and flat-panel and liquid crystal displays. In the electronics industry, PGEs are used in computer hard disks, hybridized integrated circuits, and multilayer ceramic capacitors.Aside from their industrial applications, PGEs are used in such other fields as health, consumer goods, and finance. Platinum, for example, is used in medical implants, such as pacemakers, and PGEs are used in cancer-fighting drugs. Platinum alloys are an ideal choice for jewelry because of their white color, strength, and resistance to tarnish. Platinum, palladium, and rhodium in the form of coins and bars are also used as investment commodities, and various financial instruments based on the value of these PGEs are traded on major exchanges.PGEs are among the rarest metals; Earth’s upper crust contains only about 0.0005 part per million (ppm) platinum. Today, the average grade of PGEs in ores that are mined primarily for their PGE concentrations varies from 5 to 15 ppm, although the concentration of PGEs in hand-picked ore specimens may range from tens to hundreds of parts per million.More than 100 different minerals have one of the PGEs as an essential component. PGE minerals occur as native metals. They also occur as compounds with other transition metals (copper, iron, mercury, nickel, and silver), post-transition metals (bismuth, lead, and tin), metalloids (antimony, arsenic, and tellurium), and nonmetals (selenium and sulfur).From 1900 to 2011, approximately 14,200 metric tons of PGEs was produced, and roughly 95 percent of that production (13,500 metric tons) took place between 1960 and 2011. The breakdown of production by country shows that, since 1900, about 90 percent of the production came from South Africa and Russia. The secondary supply of platinum,},

	abstract = {One dominant challenge facing the development of biorefineries is achieving consistent system throughput with highly variant biomass feedstock quality and handling performance. Current handling unit operations are adapted from other sectors (primarily agriculture), where some simplifying assumptions about granular mechanics and flow performance do not translate well to a highly compressible and anisotropic material with nonlinear time- and stress-dependent properties. This work explores the shear and frictional properties of loblolly pine at multiple experimental test apparatus and particle scales to elucidate a property window that defines the shear behavior over a range of material attributes (particle size, size distribution, moisture content, etc.). In general, it was observed that the bulk internal friction and apparent cohesion depend strongly on both the stress state of the sample in granular shear testers and the overall particle size and distribution span. For equipment designed to characterize the quasi-static shear stress failure of bulk materials ranging from 50 to 1,000 ml in test volume, similar test results were observed for finely milled particles (50\% passing size of 1.4 mm) with a narrow size distribution (span between 10 and 90\% passing size of 0.9 mm), while stress chaining and over-torque issues persisted for the bench-scale test apparatus for larger particle sizes or widely dispersed sample sizes. Measurement of the anisotropic particle–particle friction ranged from coefficients of approximately 0.20 to 0.45 and resulted in significantly higher and more variable friction measurements for larger particle sizes and in perpendicular alignment orientations. To supplement these laboratory-scale properties, this work explores the flow of loblolly pine and Douglas fir through a pilot-scale wedge-shaped hopper and a screw feeder. For the gravity-driven hopper flow, the critical arching distance and mass discharge rate ranged from approximately 10 to 30 mm and 2 to 16 tons/hour, respectively, for both materials, where the arching distance depends strongly on the overall particle size and depends less on the hopper inclination angle. Comparatively, the auger feeder was found to be much more impacted by the size of the particles, where smaller particles had a more consistent and stable flow while consuming less power.},

Machine learning models trained with numerical simulation data can provide a faster alternative to traditional simulators. Here we present U-FNO, a novel neural network architecture for solving multiphase flow problems with superior accuracy, speed, and data efficiency. U-FNO is designed based on the newly proposed Fourier neural operator (FNO), which has shown excellent performance in single-phase flows. We extend the FNO-based architecture to a highly complex CO2-water multiphase problem with wide ranges of permeability and porosity heterogeneity, anisotropy, reservoir conditions, injection configurations, flow rates, and multiphase flow properties. The U-FNO architecture is more accurate in gas saturation and pressure buildup predictions than the original FNO and a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) benchmark. Meanwhile, it has superior data utilization efficiency, requiring only a third of the training data to achieve the equivalent accuracy as CNN. U-FNO provides superior performance in highly heterogeneous geological formations and critically important applications such as gas saturation and pressure buildup “fronts” determination. The trained model can serve as a general-purpose alternative to routine numerical simulations of 2D-radial CO2 injection problems with significant speed-ups than traditional simulators.},

The design of monopiles relies on empirical data from tests performed on long, slender, small-diameter piles loaded predominantly in shear. In contrast, a monopile is a large-diameter, relatively short pile on which load is applied with a large eccentricity. With centrifuge tests as the basis, this paper investigates the behaviour of a rigid pile loaded with a high eccentricity. A test series was carried out to simulate idealized monotonic load cases for monopiles supporting an offshore wind turbine. Centrifuge tests were performed on model monopiles subjected to stress distributions equal to prototype monopiles with pile diameters ranging from 1–5 m and eccentricities ranging from 8.25–17.75 pile diameters.

However, due to the high dimensionality of their input data and network weights, FNOs have so far only been applied to two-dimensional or small three-dimensional problems. To remove this limited problem-size barrier, we propose a model-parallel version of FNOs based on domain-decomposition of both the input data and network weights. We demonstrate that our model-parallel FNO is able to predict time-varying PDE solutions of over 3.2 billion variables on Summit using up to 768 GPUs and show an example of training a distributed FNO on the Azure cloud for simulating multiphase CO\$\_2\$ dynamics in the Earth's subsurface.},

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.},

	abstract = {Magnetorheological fluids involve multi-physics phenomena which are manifested by interactions between structural mechanics, electromagnetism and rheological fluid flow. In comparison with analytical models, numerical models employed for magnetorheological fluid applications are thought to be more advantageous, as they can predict more phenomena, more parameters of design, and involve fewer model assumptions. On that basis, the state-of-the-art numerical methods that investigate the multi-physics behaviour of magnetorheological fluids in different applications are reviewed in this article. Theories, characteristics, limitations and considerations employed in numerical models are discussed. Modelling of magnetic field has been found to be rather an uncomplicated affair in comparison to modelling of fluid flow field which is rather complicated. This is because, the former involves essentially one phenomenon/mechanism, whereas the latter involves a plethora of phenomena/mechanisms such as laminar versus turbulent rheological flow, incompressible versus compressible flow, and single- versus two-phase flow. Moreover, some models are shown to be still incapable of predicting the rheological nonlinear behaviour of magnetorheological fluids although they can predict the dynamic characteristics of the system.},

	abstract = {The efficient transport of solid particles using polymeric fluids is an important step in many industrial operations. Different viscoelastic fluids have been designed for this purpose, however, the effects of elasticity have not been fully integrated in examining the particle-carrying capacity of the fluids. In this work, two elastic fluid formulations were employed to experimentally clarify the effect of elasticity on the particle drag coefficient as a proxy model for measuring carrying capacity. Fluids were designed to have a constant shear viscosity within a specific range of shear rates, γ˙{\textless}50(1/s), while possessing distinct (longest) relaxation times to investigate the influence of elasticity. It is shown that for dilute polymeric solutions, microfluidic rheometry must be practiced to obtain a reliable relaxation time (as one of the measures of viscoelasticity), which is on the order of milliseconds. A calibrated experimental setup, furnished with two advanced particle velocity measurement techniques and spheres with different characteristics, was used to quantify the effect of elasticity on the drag coefficient. These experiments led to a unique dataset in moderate levels of Weissenberg numbers, 0{\textless}Wi{\textless}8.5. The data showed that there is a subtle reduction in the drag coefficient at low levels of elasticity (Wi{\textless}1), and a considerable enhancement at high levels of elasticity (Wi{\textgreater}1). The experimental results were then compared with direct numerical simulation predictions yielding R2=0.982. These evaluations endorse the numerically quantified behaviors for the drag coefficient to be used to compare the particle-carrying capacity of different polymeric fluids under different flow conditions.},

A four-way coupled point-particle method is employed where all relevant interactions between an external magnetic field, a magnetic fluid and discrete immersed particles are taken into account. Particle–particle interaction is modelled by a hard-sphere collision model which takes the interstitial fluid effects into account. First, the motion of rigid spherical particles in a paramagnetic liquid is studied in single- and two-particle systems. We find good agreements between our numerical results and experiments performed in a paramagnetic liquid exposed to a non-homogeneous magnetic field, also in the case of two colliding particles. Next, we investigate the magneto-Archimedes separation of particles with different mass densities in many-particle systems interacting with the fluid. Our results reveal that history effects and interparticle interactions significantly influence the levitation dynamics of particles and have a detrimental impact on the separation performance. We also investigate the effect of particle size and initial distribution on the separation performance. Results show that a reduction in the particle size from 4 to 2 mm leads to a 40\%40\%40{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\% increase in the separation time. Moreover, preseparation of particles into two groups of light and heavy particles decreases the separation time by 33\%33\%33{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%.

The large magnetic susceptibility of ferrofluids allows the mobilization of ferrofluid through permeable rock and soil by the application of strong external magnetic fields. We have developed simulation capabilities for both miscible and immiscible conceptualizations of ferrofluid flow through porous media in response to magnetic forces arising from the magnetic field of a rectangular permanent magnet. The flow of ferrofluid is caused by the magnetization of the particles and their attraction toward a magnet, regardless of the orientation of the magnet. The steps involved in calculating the flow of ferrofluid are (1) calculation of the external magnetic field, (2) calculation of the gradient of the external magnetic field, (3) calculation of the magnetization of the ferrofluid, and (4) assembly of the magnetic body force term and addition of this term to the standard pressure gradient and gravity force terms. We compare numerical simulations to laboratory measurements of the magnetic field, fluid pressures, and the two‐dimensional flow of ferrofluid to demonstrate the applicability of the methods coded in the numerical simulators. We present an example of the use of the simulator for a field‐scale application of ferrofluids for barrier verification.},

This work reports a droplet-manipulation method based on particle-stabilized emulsions, where the magnetic particles adsorbed to the droplet surface serve as the actuator. The movement and the release of the droplet can be controlled by applying an external magnetic field. A lattice Boltzmann model for a three-phase system containing liquids and solid particles is adopted, which could provide a full coupling between fluids and particles. The effectiveness of the present droplet-manipulation method is validated through experiments and numerical simulations. Furthermore, the numerical simulation can provide insight into the interactions between the magnetic particles and the droplet during the droplet-driven process. To drive the droplet successfully, the magnetic particle needs to adhere to its surface and act as an ”engine” to provide the driving force. As it is a surface-tension-dominant problem, the capillary effect can be considered as an ”energy transfer station”. The magnetic driving force on the particle is transmitted primarily to the droplet through interfacial capillary forces at the three-phase contact line, which assists the droplet in overcoming the viscous resistance and moving forward. A dimensionless number is proposed as a predictor of droplet transport and particle detachment.},

A doublet well configuration with a layered (aquitard-aquifer-aquitard) generic reservoir is simulated for cases of continuous operation and seasonal-cycle operation scenarios. Neural network-based surrogate models are developed for the two scenarios and applied to generate the Pareto fronts of the HT-RTES performance for four potential HT-RTES sites. The developed Pareto optimal solutions indicate the performance of HT-RTES is operation-scenario (i.e., fluid cycle) and reservoir-site dependent, and the performance metrics have competing effects for a given site and a given fluid cycle. The developed neural network models can be applied to identify suitable sites for HT-RTES, and the proposed framework sheds light on the design of resilient HT-RTES systems.},

	url = {https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/32139},
	abstract = {Ferrofluids are stable dispersions of magnetic nanoparticles in a liquid carrier. The easily controllable magnetization of ferrofluids has motivated their use in a broad range of applications, from the non-intrusive imaging of organic tissues to the sealing and stability improvement of bearings. More recently, experiments verified the feasibility of injecting nanoparticles with specifically-designed coatings into permeable rocks without significant retentions or permeability loss. The possibility of controlling fluid displacements in a porous medium by manipulating magnetic stresses with an applied magnetic field suggests ferrofluids have a potential for subsurface applications, particularly in the field of enhanced oil recovery. Although extensive research has been devoted to the mechanics of ferrofluids, this topic is never analyzed under the conditions that are likely to occur in the subsurface environments. In particular, research on the behavior of two-phase systems in which the ferrofluid is wetting is still lacking. This work has the goal of simulating immiscible displacements influenced by the magnetic stresses acting on a wetting ferrofluid at pore scale. The simulations are based on a model for the quasi-static displacement of the liquid interface that couples the effects of the fluid flow with the magnetic stresses. An approach for the numerical simulation is developed based on a level set method for tracking the interface displacement, which is suitable for the complex shapes appearing in the pore space. The explicit-jump immersed interface method, which handles irregular domains with non-conforming grids, is employed in specific versions for the fluid flow and the magnetic field. The results indicate that the magnetic stress distribution is strongly affected by the configuration of the magnetic field in the regions of proximity between liquid interface and the solid surface. By applying a field parallel to the flow path, the magnetic stresses push the non-wetting phase away from the solid surfaces resulting in an interface configuration that reduces the flow viscous stresses and thus favors applications related to the transport of non-wetting liquids. A field perpendicular to the flow path generates magnetic stresses that contribute to the mobilization of ganglia trapped in snap-off geometries, suggesting ferrofluids can be used to reduce residual oil saturations in reservoirs in synergy with other methods.},

Understanding proppant transport in complex fracture networks play a critical role in estimating propped fracture dimensions and reducing uncertainty in well drainage estimation. This paper presents a comprehensive review of several laboratory and numerical simulation studies which have been carried out over the past decade to evaluate proppant transport in the complex fracture networks. A better understanding of proppant movement in fracture networks with subsidiary fractures can help with optimizing fracture treatment designs and understanding what impact this transport may have on resulting production.

They are based on the solution for the steady flow of a viscous fluid, mixed with spherical particles, in a channel, which is obtained assuming an empirical constitutive model. This proppant transport model is applied to two fracture geometries – Khristianovich–Zheltov–Geertsma–De Klerk (KGD) and pseudo-3D (P3D). Numerical simulations show that the proposed method makes it possible to capture proppant plug formation and growth, as well as the gravitational settling for both geometries. A dimensionless parameter, whose magnitude reflects the intensity of the settling, is introduced for the P3D fracture.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional distinct element code is utilized to study hydraulic fracture propagation and proppant transport in a two-layer formation with stress drop. The fracture is initiated in the primary layer with high stress and propagates upwards into the low stress layer in the viscosity dominated regime. The hydro-mechanical coupling causes pinching and smaller aperture at the interface between the stress layers. The results indicate that the pinching at the stress interface can greatly affect the proppant transport. Critical proppant size can be defined above which the proppant is blocked and cannot enter the low stress zone. Large sized proppant could further intensify the pinching effect because the screen out leads decreased fluid supply to the low stress zone. Small sized proppant, on the other hand, could ease the pinching by increasing viscosity of the slurry relative to clean fluid. In order to have an ability to determine the critical proppant size, we have developed a relation between the dimensionless pinching aperture and the dimensionless stress for viscosity dominated fractures. This relation can be applied to estimate the pinching aperture for any given injection and rock parameters, and to provide guidelines for selecting optimal proppant size in the field operations for cases of controlling fracture height growth in the vertical direction and optimizing the extent of fracture lateral propagation when carrying out the infill well fracturing.},

	abstract = {Effective hydraulic fracturing stimulation is highly reliant on the flow area and proppant pack permeability of the induced hydraulic fractures. The flow area is largely determined by proppant distribution while fracture permeability is mainly governed by proppant sizes. To create a fracture with a large flow area, small proppants are essential to maintain a minimum proppant settling velocity; on the other hand, large proppant sizes provide higher proppant pack permeability. Therefore, an optimum operational procedure, i.e., scheduling of injection rate, proppant size and volume, is required to achieve maximum well productivity index. This, however, requires both field experiments (e.g., small volume pre-job tests) and an advanced numerical simulator that couples solid and fluid transport with fracture propagation model including mass exchange between reservoir matrix and hydraulic fracture, i.e., leak-off rate. In this study, we focused on developing new modules for our in-house 3-D numerical simulator where proppant transport and reservoir performance optimization is considered. In new module Navier–Stokes equation describing fluid flow in the fracture and leak-off in the formation is coupled with mass conservation equation governing the proppant transport, and solved using finite difference approach. Fracture propagation is also one-way coupled with proppant transport and fluid flow using in-house 3D hydraulic fracturing simulator “HFWVU”. During the simulation Proppant slippage velocity is considered over wide range of hydraulic fracturing propagation regimes, i.e., toughness-dominated to viscosity-dominated cases, with small and large leak-offs. The simulation results predict that reservoir matrix permeability highly impacts the proppant size selection and pumping scheduling to achieve the optimum reservoir stimulation performance. Ignoring the fluid–solid interaction, i.e., proppant settling velocity, in hydraulic fracturing simulation leads to overestimating the efficiency of the process in wide range of operation conditions. It has also been predicted that the optimum combination of proppant size and their volume portion exists for specific reservoir and treatment conditions that can optimize fracture performance. Uncertainty analysis of the reservoir behavior using experimental design technique shows that hydraulic fracturing efficiency on production performance can be highly influenced by reservoir matrix permeability, i.e., uncontrollable variable. This implies that the same hydraulic fracturing procedure applied in conventional reservoirs might not be as efficient in unconventional reservoir and special attention to reservoir characteristics needs to be made while designing the hydraulic fracturing procedure. Followed by reservoir matrix permeability, proppant volume and relative proppant/fluid density have the highest impact on hydraulic fracturing efficiency. This study couples hydraulic fracturing simulation with reservoir simulation and is a unique approach for the further understanding of proppant transport and settling, fracture geometry variation and fracture production performance. It also provides foundation for the development of sound numerical models for hydraulic fracturing design.},

Understand the proppant transport and distribution characteristics in fracture and fracture network become a meaningful topic for its effects on the conductivities of fractures. Since experiments are expensive, and it is also difficult to consider various conditions and detect the movement of particles during experiments, numerical simulation methods are often applied. In this work, the coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) was implemented to investigate the factors affecting proppant distribution in fracture and fracture networks. First, the CFD-DEM model was built for proppant flow and settlement. We validated the model by comparing with the published numerical simulation result. After that, we designed a series of cases to investigate the effects of fracture closure, injection velocity and no-uniform opening of the inlet on proppant distribution in a single fracture. Then, the effects of proppant diameter, density and perforation height differences on proppant sorting were studied. Next, we computed the proppant transport in fracture networks considering the aperture difference, the orientation of branch fractures and leak-off in fracture tips. The simulation results in this paper can help engineers to understand the transport and distribution of proppants visually in the fracture and fracture networks in unconventional reservoirs.},

	abstract = {The effective placement of proppant in a fracture has a dominant effect on well productivity. Existing hydraulic-fracture models simplify proppant-transport calculations to varying degrees. A common assumption applied is that the average proppant velocity caused by flow is equal to the average carrier-fluid velocity, while the settling-velocity calculation uses Stokes’ law. To more accurately determine the placement of proppant in a fracture, it is necessary to account for many effects not included in previous assumptions.In this study, the motion of particles flowing with a fluid between fracture walls is simulated with a coupled computational-fluid-dynamics/discrete-element method (CFD/DEM) code that uses both particle dynamics and CFD calculations to account for both particles and fluid. These simulations (presented in metric units) determine individual particle trajectories as particle-to-particle and particle-to-wall collisions occur, and include the effect of fluid flow. The results show that the ratio of proppant diameter to fracture width governs the relative average velocity of proppant and fluid.A proppant-transport model developed from the results of the direct numerical simulations and existing correlations for particle-settling velocity has been incorporated into a fully 3D hydraulic-fracturing simulator. This simulator couples fracture geomechanics with fluid-flow and proppant-transport considerations to enable the fracture geometry and proppant distribution in the main hydraulic fracture to be determined. For two typical shale-reservoir cases, the proppant placement and width distribution have been determined, allowing comparison at the hydraulic-fracture scale, including effects observed at the particle scale. This allows for optimization of the treatment to a specific application, and the results are presented in oilfield units, considered more familiar to our readers.},

	abstract = {The micromechanics of proppant settling in quiescent fluid in a rough and relatively narrow rock fracture is investigated. The study focuses on particle–particle and particle–wall interactions in a dense-phase particle settling. The study used a coupled discrete element method and computational fluid dynamics (DEM–CFD) code because DEM–CFD is the most suitable computational method for modeling the frequent interactions of dense assembly of rigid particles and enables modeling of two-way solid–fluid interactions. Due to frequent particle–particle interactions of grains submerged in fluids, the particle interaction model in DEM is improved by the incorporation of the effects of lubrication due to a layer of fluid surrounding particles. Results of the numerical study are compared to previous experimental and theoretical relationships. The findings of the study highlight conditions that lead to proppant aggregation due to the fluid viscosity and fracture width in relation to particle diameter ratio. In the light of the DEM–CFD results, it was found that published relationships are inadequate in describing the settling rates for proppant in a rough and narrow hydraulic fracture and high fluid viscosity. Micromechanical particle interactions during settling and erratic upward and fluid counter-flow may cause proppant trajectories that are not always in the direction of gravity in a rough fracture resulting in clogging of the fracture or forming faster settling particle agglomerates. The maximum packing density 0.3–0.4 (3.9–5.9 lbs/gal) of proppant in a narrow and rough hydraulic fracture was obtained in this study, which is lower than the usually assumed one of 0.5 (9.8 lbs/gal) for any given fracture roughness.},

The interaction between a structural element and soil is investigated to validate the applicability of the parallelisation strategy. Two techniques are developed to parallelise the interpolation from soil particles to nodes to avoid a data race; the technique that is based on workload parallelisation across threads over the nodes has a higher computational efficiency. Benchmark problems of surface footing penetration and a submarine landslide are analysed to quantify the speedup of GPU parallel computing over sequential simulations on the central processing unit. The maximum speedup with the GPU used is ∼30 for single-precision calculations and decreases to ∼20 for double-precision calculations.},

In the proposed DGFD method, the computational domain can be split into multiple subdomains with nonconformal meshes. The Riemann solver (upwind flux) is introduced to evaluate the numerical flux. The impedance transition boundary condition (ITBC) is employed to facilitate fracture modeling by approximating fractures as surfaces. Numerical results show that the ITBC works well for different fracture conductivities, dipping angles, operation frequencies, as well as different sources. For both small- and large-scale fractures, it also shows good agreement with the references. The responses of fractures increase as their conductivities become larger. Large dipping angles can cause spikes on the responses in a borehole. For a magnetic source, higher operation frequencies can enhance the signal level, while for an electric source, the sensitivity to frequency is small. When no borehole is considered, the responses due to an electric source are in general larger than those due to a magnetic one. However, when a borehole with conductive mud is included, the responses can be reversed for the electric and magnetic sources. For multiple fractures outside a cased borehole, the signal level of an electric source is significantly reduced, while that of a magnetic source remains at a similar level compared with the scenario without a casing. With the proposed technique, multiscale modeling of hydraulic fractures in complicated geophysical environments becomes possible.},

The approach builds upon a fusion of two existing high-performance simulators for reservoir-scale behavior: the GEOS code for hydromechanical evolution during stimulation and the TOUGH+ code for multi-phase flow during production. The reservoir-scale simulations are informed by experimental and modeling studies at the laboratory scale to incorporate important micro-scale mechanical processes and chemical reactions occurring within the fractures, the shale matrix, and at the fracture-fluid interfaces. These processes include, among others, changes in stimulated fracture permeability as a result of proppant behavior rearrangement or embedment, or mineral scale precipitation within pores and microfractures, at µm to cm scales. In our new modeling framework, such micro-scale testing and modeling provides upscaled hydromechanical parameters for the reservoir scale models. We are currently testing the new modeling framework using field data and core samples from the Hydraulic Fracturing Field Test (HFTS), a recent field-based joint research experiment with intense monitoring of hydraulic fracturing and shale production in the Wolfcamp Formation in the Permian Basin (USA). Below, we present our approach coupling the reservoir simulators GEOS and TOUGH+ informed by upscaled parameters from micro-scale experiments and modeling. We provide a brief overview of the HFTS and the available field data, and then discuss the ongoing application of our new workflow to the HFTS data set.},

	abstract = {In 2017 and 2019, injection testing was carried out in three zones in a vertical well in granite at the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy site near Milford, Utah, USA. In several injection cycles, flowback was implemented rather than shut-in. The goal was to explore an alternative to prolonged shut-in periods for inferring closure stress, formation compressibility, and formation permeability (permeability thickness product). The flowback procedures involved a cyclic flowback/shut-in, while pressure decreased. The flowback data are presented, and analyses are shown. The inferred closure stress(es) from flowback analyses are lower than for equivalent injection cycles that were strictly shut-in. Relatively high formation compressibility obtained from the flowback analyses indicates an extensive, fractured system. This study also includes numerical simulation of the flowback events. The numerical model shows that the rebound pressure is not necessarily the lower bound of the minimum principal stress. The signature of stiffness change can be identified as the process when the depletion mainly transitions from hydraulic fracture to natural fractures from numerical analysis. Overall, flowback potentially has advantages over shut-in because of the reduced time to closure.},

An oedometer setup customized with an EM wave source is simulated numerically at the continuum level. Solid matrix equilibrium, fluid flow and heat transfer equations are solved together with the laws of electromagnetism, i.e. Maxwell’s equations, using the COMSOL multiphysics code. Numerical simulations involve EM excitation in a fluid-saturated isotropic, homogeneous, linear thermo-poro-elastic and lossy (EM wave loses power as it propagates in a lossy material.) medium at both 50 MHz and 2.45 GHz frequencies. It is found that the thermal expansion contrast between the fluid and solid phase results into a local buildup of fluid pressure that cannot dissipate due to the very low permeability of the medium, hence promoting fracturing.},

	abstract = {Selective breakdown of mineralized particles by using high-voltage pulses (HVP) has been reported, yet its mechanisms are not fully understood, and the HVP setting factors affecting its efficacy in ore pre-concentration for the mining industry are not established. This study investigates the electro-dynamic mechanisms of electric breakdown by using the time-transient dielectric breakdown model and the finite-difference numerical method. Monte-Carlo method with random sampling is applied to calculate breakdown probabilities. The model and the selected parameters have been validated by the published experimental data of the electric breakdown of mineralized synthetic particles. The simulations of pulse rising time from 150 ns to 1 μs showed that the HVP breakdown threshold of rock particles gradually increased as the pulse rising time decreased. This suggests that to minimize the mis-breakdown of barren rocks in the HVP-enabled ore pre-concentration application, it is important to use a generator with a short pulse rising time. Shorter pulses also led to a higher probability of the internal breakdown of the mineralized particles. The simulations indicate that inhomogeneity of conductivity in an ore particle caused the streamers to bend toward the area of inclusion with high conductivity in a host rock matrix, which increased the probabilities of the breakdown of this mineralized particle. This phenomenon was more pronounced as conductivity rose. High-conductivity inclusions can reduce the minimum voltages required for the breakdown of the mineralized particles.},

	abstract = {Fluid-driven fracture (i.e., Hydraulic fracturing) is an important way to stimulate the well productivity in the development of unconventional reservoirs. A low-viscosity fluid called slickwater is widely used in the unconventional fracturing. It is a big challenge to simulate the particle (or proppant) transport in the low-viscosity fluid in a field-scale fracture. A new model to simulate particle transport in the low-viscosity fluid in a field-scale fracture is developed. First, a new parameter is defined, called the rate of proppant bed wash-out, by which we incorporated the mechanism of proppant bed wash-out into Eulerian-Eulerian proppant transport model. Second, we proposed a novel way to consider the effect of proppant settling on the proppant concentration in the upper layer (or suspending layer) to accurately simulate the proppant transport. Additionally, a dimension reduction strategy was used to make the model quickly solved. Our simulation results were compared with published experimental data and they were consistent. After validation, the effect of fluid viscosity, injection rate, fracture height, and proppant concentration on the proppant distribution in a fracture is investigated. This study provides a new model to simulate particle transport. Meanwhile, it gives critical insights into understanding particle transport in the field-scale fracture. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 64: 3542–3552, 2018},

	abstract = {A central issue in hydraulic fracturing treatment in petroleum wells is the transport of proppant particles by the injection fluid. In this paper, we present an innovative proppant transport model in a fixed rectangular- and elliptic-shaped slots. The proposed model is an improvement to the current modeling of proppant transport by applying a non-oscillatory numerical scheme which has high accuracy everywhere in solution domain, even close to the steep gradients. In addition, inertia, fracture wall, and concentration effects on proppant settling along with slurry evolution as a function of proppant concentration has been considered. This paper introduces the mathematical equations that govern the proppant transport phenomenon and discusses special front capturing numerical techniques, boundary conditions, coupling between proppant and slurry mass conservation equations and time stepping restrictions required for the solution stability. We incorporated published correlations obtained from proppant transport laboratory experiments in our numerical model to better capture the physics of the problem. 5th- order WENO scheme was used to avoid oscillation and diffusion at the proppant front since traditional finite difference discretization was found to be insufficient in solving the hyperbolic transport partial differential equations. Results show that the technique used in this study can capture the proppant distribution with minimum oscillation and diffusion. A series of sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the legitimacy of these assumptions and to provide guidelines that allow more accurate predictions of the proppant and fluid transfer. Numerical results are presented to show how proppant distribution is impacted by the injection fluid viscosity, density difference between proppant particles and injection fluid, proppant size, and fluid flow injection rate. Results of the sensitivity analysis illustrate the significance of choosing appropriate viscosity of the injection fluid as small changes in the viscosity may cause noticeable effects on the concentration distribution. In addition, we found that variation of proppant size and density within a reasonable range have a modest effect on proppant concentration distribution. Furthermore, we also investigated the amount of gravity driven vertical motion of proppant which is driven by density differences (convection) and compare it to a second gravity driven motion which is proppant settlement. Both of these two well recognized mechanisms can occur inside a fracture during proppant placement, however, the importance of each mechanism as a function of proppant injection design parameters is not fully understood.},

	abstract = {The application of slickwater fracturing technology along with horizontal drilling has revolutionized oil and gas energy industry. Solid particles, i.e. proppant, are mixed with slickwater and injected into the formation to keep fractures opened after fracturing. Many researchers have studied the proppant transport and distribution in vertical fractures. However, in unconventional reservoirs with multiple bedding layers and preexisting natural fractures, hydraulically induced fractures with inclined angles are often generated. Thus, proppant transport in various angles of fracture geometry is necessary to study further. In this study, multiple case studies including fracture inclination angle, proppant size, and injection point location were performed to experimentally quantify proppant delivery mechanism in an inclined fracture. Laboratory parameters were scaled down from field conditions to successfully capture proppant transport mechanism without any significant boundary effect. Sand slurry was pumped into a fracture channel and proppant placement was recorded at various conditions. The effect of individual parameter was scientifically analyzed at predetermined condition to quantify the proppant transport trend within an inclined fracture. Friction due to wall roughness and different effective vertical gravitational forces completely change proppant transport behaviors in inclined plane. Frictional force acts stronger, as the fracture plane angle becomes closer to the horizontal plane. Strong wall friction effect creates a thin suspension area rather than settling and forming compact dune. Some proppants are invested for the suspension zone instead of dune area. This leads to greater proppant coverage area, yet smaller dune area. Suspended zone is the most differentiating feature compared to vertical fractures. There is almost no suspended zone observed in the vertical fractures, yet suspended zone is well observed and prevalent in inclined fractures. Fine mesh sized proppants travel farther due to low settling velocity. It therefore forms a well distributed sand pack. Fine particles are heavily influenced by the flow, therefore it follows the streamline of the incoming flow. They also experience strong wall friction. Thus suspension zone and total coverage area increase with smaller proppant size. In addition, the difference between having a single inlet point at various depth compared to having several opened inlet points provides an insight while operating in field environment. The inlet location determines the shape of the sandpack, especially near the wellbore. Lower injection point pushes the sandpack farther, yet this poses a potential wellbore closure or collapse.},

	abstract = {Slickwater fracturing is a popular stimulation treatment in the unconventional oil and gas industry. It creates thin and long fractures that connect to pre-existing natural fractures and generate complex fracture networks. A large fraction of the fractured area is not usually propped due to the high density of typical proppants (sand) and low viscosity of the fracturing fluid. The goal of this work is to understand and optimize proppant transport in complex fracture networks. In this paper, proppant transport in fracture intersections is studied experimentally (using laboratory size slots) and numerically (using a multiphase dense discrete phase model). The orientation of natural fractures, proppant size and shear rate have been varied and the injected proppant volume is kept constant. Both experiments and simulations show three zones: bottom immobile sand bed zone, middle flowing slurry zone, and top clear fluid zone. The sand injected early forms the bottom of the sand bed; the sand injected later moves downstream and forms the top part of the bed. The entrance eroded region increases as the shear rate (or equivalently the water injection rate) increases. The sand bed length increases as the shear rate increases. The equilibrium sand bed height decreases as the shear rate increases and the sand size decreases. Proppant placement in the bypass slot increases as the shear rate increases and the bypass angle decreases. The numerical model using a dense discrete phase model (DDPM) captures the key features of the sand bed formation and transport.},

	abstract = {We implement proppant transport in a three-dimensional hydraulic fracturing simulator, including proppant settlement due to gravity, tip screen-out, and fracture closure. Constitutive equations are used that account for processes that can cause the flowing fraction of proppant to be different from the volumetric fraction of proppant. The constitutive equations capture the transition from Poiseuille flow to Darcy flow as the slurry transitions from dilute mixture to packed bed. We introduce new constitutive equations that allow the simulator to seamlessly describe the process of fracture closure, including a nonlinear joint closure law expressing fracture compliance and roughness and accounting for the effect of proppant accumulation into a packed layer between the fracture walls. We perform sensitivity analysis simulations to investigate the effect of fluid viscosity, proppant density, proppant size, and formation permeability. The simulations confirm that tip screen-out can limit fracture length, cause proppant banking, and increase injection pressure. Sensitivity analysis indicates that reasonably accurate results can be achieved without excessive mesh refinement. We also perform a simulation of hydraulic fracture propagation through a complex natural fracture network. In this simulation, proppant tends to accumulate at the intersections between natural and hydraulic fractures. Overall, the results suggest that in very low permeability formations, proppant settling is a major problem for proppant placement because proppant tends to gravitationally settle before fracture closure can occur. Because leakoff is so slow, proppant immobilization through bridging is critical for vertical proppant placement. Bridging can occur at aperture approximately three times greater than particle diameter, which will occur much sooner after shut-in than full mechanical closure. Even though larger diameter proppant settles more rapidly, it may lead to better proppant placement because it will bridge sooner, at a larger fracture aperture. These results also suggest that it is critical to optimize injection schedule in order to avoid tip screen-out, which leads to a shorter, wider fracture in which bridging is less likely to occur. Our modeling approach can be used practically for optimization of proppant placement through selection of fluid properties, proppant properties, and injection schedule.},

The developments are based on a continuum constitutive model for a slurry, which is approximated by an empirical formula. It is shown that the problem under consideration features a two-dimensional flow and a boundary layer, which effectively introduces slip at the boundary and allows us to describe a transition from Poiseuille flow to Darcy’s law for high proppant concentrations. The expressions for both the outer (i.e. outside the boundary layer) and inner (i.e. within the boundary layer) solutions are obtained in terms of the particle concentration, particle velocity and fluid velocity. Unfortunately, these solutions require the numerical solution of an integral equation, and, as a result, the development of a proppant transport model for hydraulic fracturing based on these results is not practicable. To reduce the complexity of the problem, an approximate solution is introduced. To validate the use of this approximation, the error is estimated for different regimes of flow. The approximate solution is then used to calculate the expressions for the slurry flux and the proppant flux, which are the basis for a model that can be used to account for proppant transport with gravitational settling in a fully coupled hydraulic fracturing simulator.},

Results of these experiments were used to formulate a new slurry transport model which was incorporated in a fully three-dimensional fracture simulator. The model was tested and verified against experimental observations of slurry transport in a 4 foot by 16 foot slot model. Results of the study indicate that proppant slurry transport can be accurately modeled when the effects of single particle settling, density driven flow, particle velocity profiles, and slurry rheology are accounted for.It has been a long-sought goal in hydraulic fracturing technology to accurately predict proppant slurry transport in non-Newtonian fluids. Numerous references exist in the petroleum literature describing various aspects of particle and slurry transport.In the earliest studies relating to hydraulic fracturing applications, Kern and Perkins investigated sand transport in low viscosity fluids. They concluded that transport relies on high frontal velocity of the fluid and that rapid sedimentation of sand creates an immobile "dune" along the bottom of the fracture which restricts the fracture height open to flow. This leads to high local fluid velocities and establishment of an equilibrium sand bed height.Other authors reported observing significant settling and less than perfect transport in both horizontal and vertical fractures. These studies, conducted in 1965-67, included the effects of particle size, drag coefficient, density, velocity, viscosity, and fluid yield point. The authors concluded that settling and particle segregation occur even in horizontal fractures and that the dense slurry accumulated on the bottom of the crack remains mobile but has a lower velocity than the average fluid speed.In 1977, Novotny reported results of proppant transport studies conducted with non-Newtonian fluids. These observations showed that particles occupy different positions across the width of a vertical fracture at various shear rates and solids loadings. He also reported that particle settling rate is strongly influenced by fluid shear rate and the presence of the fracture walls.In the same year Clark, et al, used a large scale slot flow model similar to that employed in this study to investigate proppant settling velocities after shut-in. These studies concluded that particle dusting can result in an increased settling velocity. The results presented were preliminary and did not address bulk slurry movement.At about the same time Hannah, Harrington, and others utilized a cylindrical flow cell to study single particle settling rates in non-Newtonian fluids while under representative shear. They concluded that Stoke's Law can be applied, but may need to be modified by inclusion of an additional term to account for crosslinked fluid behavior.These conclusions were partially supported by later work which indicated that single particle settling in crosslinked fluid depends on more complex parameters than just fluid viscosity.},

	abstract = {Bed load transport is the movement of particles along the top of a bed through rolling, saltation, and suspension created by turbulent lift above the bed surface. Based on experimental work, early investigators suggested that bed load transport may be an important mechanism during field scale hydraulic fracturing. However, later studies suggested that bed load transport is much more important in the laboratory than at field scale because the rate of bed load transport does not scale with fracture height. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the idea that bed load transport is significant at the field scale. Patankar et al. (2002) and Wang et al. (2003) presented new laboratory scale experiments on bed load proppant transport and proposed correlations to match the data. The correlations have subsequently been applied directly in field scale hydraulic fracturing simulators and have been used to design completion strategies and select proppants. This paper reviews correlations for sediment and slurry transport and provides a reanalysis of the laboratory results from Patankar et al. (2002). The analysis finds that the experiments can be well-described using classical correlations for sediment and slurry flow. The correlations are applied without adjusting any free parameters to fit the data. The analysis suggests that the total amount of proppant that can be transported in bed load transport in laboratory experiments is roughly similar to the amount transported at field scale. Because much greater volumes of proppant are injected at the field scale, the implication is that bed load transport is negligible in the great majority of field scale hydraulic fracturing treatments.},

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) has been launched as a catalyst to the low-carbon energy transitions. The limited understanding of the subsurface processes is a major obstacle for rapid and widespread UHS implementation. We use microfluidics to experimentally describe pore-scale multiphase hydrogen flow in an aquifer storage scenario. In a series of drainage-imbibition experiments we report the effect of capillary number on hydrogen saturations, displacement/trapping mechanisms, dissolution kinetics and contact angle hysteresis. We find that the hydrogen saturation after injection (drainage) increases with increasing capillary number. During hydrogen withdrawal (imbibition) two distinct mechanisms control the displacement and residual trapping – I1 and I2 imbibition mechanisms, respectively. Local hydrogen dissolution kinetics show dependency on injection rate and hydrogen cluster size. Dissolved global hydrogen concentration corresponds up to 28\% of reported hydrogen solubility, indicating pore-scale non-equilibrium dissolution. Contact angles show hysteresis and vary between 17 and 56° Our results provide key UHS experimental data to improve understanding of hydrogen multiphase flow behaviour.},

	abstract = {Subsurface hydrogen storage in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and saline formations is a potential option for storing hydrogen at large scales. These subsurface formations need to store sufficient hydrogen efficiently and securely, and the hydrogen must be withdrawn in adequate quantities on demand. In this study, we investigate the reservoir, geological, and operational controls that enable large-scale hydrogen storage and maximize hydrogen injection and withdrawal from depleted natural gas reservoirs. Hydrogen injection, storage, and withdrawal scenarios were computed using a reservoir simulator. Sensitivity analyses exposed the crucial parameters to achieve the goal of optimum storage and withdrawal of hydrogen. We determined that reservoirs with smaller pressures at the start of storage operations are suitable for hydrogen storage if wellhead pressure constraints permit. Steeply dipping reservoirs enable better hydrogen withdrawal if the reservoirs have good permeability (greater than 100 mD) and the injection/withdrawal well is placed updip within the reservoir. Permeable reservoirs and reservoirs with sufficient thickness increase hydrogen withdrawal rates. These findings and the results of the sensitivity analyses are used to propose site selection criteria for underground storage of hydrogen in depleted gas reservoirs.},

In this study, a numerical workflow combining a 3D continuum–discrete mechanical coupling approach with the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is developed to simulate the coupled thermal–mechanical process in a rock/proppant system and to investigate the role of the time-dependent deformation of shale rocks on proppant embedment and fracture conductivity loss under varying temperature and stress conditions. The numerical workflow is first compared with an experiment under varying temperature and stress conditions to calibrate the elastic, plastic, viscoelastic, and thermal properties of the shale rock, as well as the proppant properties. Then, the effect of fracture axial and confining stress, numbers of proppant layers, proppant size, proppant spatial distribution, and proppant crushing is systematically investigated. The simulation results indicate that when the rock creep is significant, large size and a multilayer of proppant structure are suggested to maintain the fracture conductivity. The small percentage of particle breakage in a proppant assembly plays a less important role in the long-term maintenance of fracture conductivity. The findings of this study will shed light on the creep-induced proppant embedment mechanisms at reservoir conditions as well as their influence on the sustainability of fracture conductivity over long periods of time.},

	abstract = {Proppant selection in hydraulic fracturing operations is a crucial decision that influences the productivity and performance of stimulated wells. In hybrid completion designs, proppants of various sizes and materials are often mixed and incorporated into the pumping schedule. Optimization of mixing proppants of various sizes and materials has the potential to maximize proppant pack conductivity and to enhance the reservoir production performance. In this work, an experiment/simulation-integrated workflow, which combines the discrete element method (DEM) and lattice Boltzmann (LB) modeling with laboratory penetrometer experiments, was adopted to investigate the effects of proppant mixtures of different sizes and materials on the fracture conductivity. The DEM was used to simulate proppant compaction and rearrangement. Proppant embedment was determined by a load-embedment correlation obtained from the penetrometer experiments. The pore structure of the proppant pack was extracted from the DEM model and then imported into the LB simulator as internal boundary conditions of flow modeling to determine the time-dependent conductivity of the proppant-supported fracture. The integrated workflow demonstrates that the conductivity of a mixed-sized proppant pack is not simply the arithmetic average of the conductivities of the pure proppant packs. The selection of proppants with close sizes has a minor impact on the fracture conductivity when proppants develop to multilayers; whereas mixing with a much finer proppant size will downgrade the fracture conductivity significantly. It is demonstrated that proppant size combination has a lesser effect on the fracture conductivity compared to proppant material combinations. This study also suggests that the application of combinations of sand and premium proppants and modification of proppant injection schedule in the fracturing treatment design can mitigate fracture closure and improve fracture conductivity. This study investigated fundamental mechanisms of proppant mixture at the pore scale, which have significant implications to the optimization of hydraulic fracturing and proppant placement designs.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new method to predict fracture conductivity for channel fracturing by lattice-Boltzmann-method (LBM) and computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD). Firstly, the deformation of the proppant pillar is tested using uniaxial compression experiments. A non-uniform fracture width model considering the nonlinear deformation of fracture and the embedment of proppant pillars is established. Then, an improved model based on LBM-CFD is proposed to simulate the flow field within the fracture and calculate the fracture conductivity. Finally, parametric analysis is carried out to understand the effects of closure stress, elastic modulus of the reservoir rock, proppant pillar's shape and proppant pillar's spacing on fracture width and conductivity. The results showed that the conductivity decreases gradually with closure stress and increases with elastic modulus. The proppant pillar with the smallest shape ratio can provide the highest conductivity. When the ratio of the proppant pillar's diameter to spacing is about 0.5, the conductivity for channel fracturing is best. The time of proppant-laden fluid (PLF) pulse and proppant-free fluid (PFF) pulse are the keys to the successful implementation of channel fracturing. The simulation results have been applied to the optimization of the pulse time in Shengli Oilfield. The field application proves that channel fracturing design based on our method could result in a large increase in well production. This paper gives critical insights for predicting the conductivity for channel fracturing, which could serve as guidelines for the optimization of proppant pillar's parameters and pulse time in channel fracturing design.},

First, an analytical model for channel fracturing conductivity is proposed. Then, a DEM model calibrated by using experimental results is set up to investigate the deformation of proppant pillar. Finally, the analytical model of fracture conductivity is implemented in the DEM model to predict conductivity during fracture closing. Parametric analyses are carried out to understand the effects of four factors: proppant size combination, concentration, time ratio τ and elastic modulus to stress ratio λ. Conductivity generally decreases during fracture closing and increases with the increasing proppant size and proppant concentration. The ratio of the pulsing time of proppant laden fluid to the pulsing time of the clean fluid is the key parameter for the field operation. A large time ratio could enhance the pillar stability though it may lead to the damage of fracture conductivity. For given rock modulus, closing stress and proppant size, the optimal range of time ratio can be given as a guidance for field operation. The field application of channel fracturing in the Shengli Oilfield proves that the optimized range of time ratio τ based on the proposed theoretical model is valid. The porosity of proppant pillar first decreases due to compression and then increases during fracture closing period because of the breakdown of the proppant pillar and the resulted particle movement outward. This paper gives insights for understanding the channel fracture conductivity and provides a practical tool for the optimization of channel fracturing design in the field.},

	abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing is a widely used method for well stimulation to enhance hydrocarbon recovery. Permeability, or fluid conductivity, of the hydraulic fracture is a key parameter to determine the fluid production rate, and is principally conditioned by fracture geometry and the distribution of the encased proppant. A numerical model is developed to describe proppant transport within a propagating blade-shaped fracture towards defining the fracture conductivity and reservoir production after fracture closure. Fracture propagation is formulated based on the PKN-formalism coupled with advective transport of an equivalent slurry representing a proppant-laden fluid. Empirical constitutive relations are incorporated to define rheology of the slurry, proppant transport with bulk slurry flow, proppant gravitational settling, and finally the transition from Poiseuille (fracture) flow to Darcy (proppant pack) flow. At the maximum extent of the fluid-driven fracture, as driving pressure is released, a fracture closure model is employed to follow the evolution of fracture conductivity with the decreasing fluid pressure. This model is capable of accommodating the mechanical response of the proppant pack, fracture closure of potentially contacting rough surfaces, proppant embedment into fracture walls, and most importantly flexural displacement of the unsupported spans of the fracture. Results show that reduced fluid viscosity increases the length of the resulting fracture, while rapid leak-off decreases it, with both characteristics minimizing fracture width over converse conditions. Proppant density and size do not significantly influence fracture propagation. Proppant settling ensues throughout fracture advance, and is accelerated by a lower viscosity fluid or greater proppant density or size, resulting in accumulation of a proppant bed at the fracture base. ‘Screen-out’ of proppant at the fracture tip can occur where the fracture aperture is only several times the diameter of the individual proppant particles. After fracture closure, proppant packs comprising larger particles exhibit higher conductivity. More importantly, high-conductivity flow channels are necessarily formed around proppant banks due to the flexural displacement of the fracture walls, which offer preferential flow pathways and significantly influence the distribution of fluid transport. Higher compacting stresses are observed around the edge of proppant banks, resulting in greater depths of proppant embedment into the fracture walls and/or an increased potential for proppant crushing.},

	abstract = {The residual opening of fluid-driven fractures is conditioned by proppant distribution and has a significant impact on fracture conductivity - a key parameter to determine fluid production rate and well performance. A 2D model follows the evolution of the residual aperture profile and conductivity of fractures partially/fully filled with proppant packs. The model accommodates the mechanical response of proppant packs in response to closure of arbitrarily rough fractures and the evolution of proppant embedment. The numerical model is validated against existing models and an analytic solution. Proppant may accumulate in a bank at the fracture base during slick water fracturing, and as hydraulic pressure is released, an arched zone forms at the top of the proppant bank as a result of partial closure of the overlaying unpropped fracture. The width and height of the arched zone decreases as the fluid pressure declines, and is further reduced where low concentrations of proppant fill the fracture or where the formation is highly compressible. This high-conductivity arch represents a preferential flow channel and significantly influences the distribution of fluid transport and overall fracture transmissivity. However, elevated compacting stresses and evolving proppant embedment at the top of the settled proppant bed reduce the aperture and diminish the effectiveness of this highly-conductive zone, with time. Two-dimensional analyses are performed on the fractures created by channel fracturing, showing that the open channels formed between proppant pillars dramatically improve fracture transmissivity if they are maintained throughout the lifetime of the fracture. However, for a fixed proppant pillar height, a large proppant pillar spacing results in the premature closure of the flow channels, while a small spacing narrows the existing channels. Such a model provides a rational means to design optimal distribution of the proppant pillars using deformation moduli of the host to control pillar deformation and flexural spans of the fracture wall.},

In particular, we define the relative impacts and interactions between proppant crushing, proppant embedment, compaction and particle rearrangement and their impacts on fluid transport. Proppant of realistic concentrations is sandwiched between split core-plugs of Marcellus shale that accommodates embedment as well as rigid steel that excludes it. Impacts of proppant crushing and embedment and roles of particulate transport in fracturing-fluid clean-up are defined. Experiments are performed under triaxial stresses with independent control on confining stress and pore pressure. Normal loading is incremented to represent reservoir drawdown with conductivity evolution recorded continuously via flow-through of brine (20,000 mg/L KCl). Proppant embedment is characterized pre- and post-test by white light optical profilometry with pre-and post-test particle size distributions of the proppant defining the impact of proppant crushing. The conductivity of propped fractures decreases by up to 95\% as effective stress is increased by 50 MPa (7000 \$\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{psi\})\$\$. This reduction is broadly independent of whether the fracture walls are rigid or deformable. The stress-sensitivity of conductivity is generally muted with increasing proppant loading concentration. We normalize fracture conductivities to equivalent permeabilities of the proppant pack to directly compare pack permeabilities. Low proppant concentrations return higher permeability at low effective stresses but lower permeability at high effective stress, relative to high proppant concentrations. This results since proppant crushing and embedment are both mitigated with increasing proppant loading concentration, as more displacement degree of freedom are added to the system and provide accommodation for interior compaction and rearrangement. Extended effective stress holding times (24 h vs {\textless} 1 h) and proppant “aging” exert little impact on transient changes in fracture conductivity.},

	abstract = {Without remorse, fossil fuels have made a huge contribution to global development in all of its forms. However, the recent scientific outlooks are currently shifting as more research is targeted towards promoting a carbon-free economy in addition to the use of electric power from renewable sources. While renewable energy sources may be a solution to the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuel they are yet season-dependent faced with major atmospheric drawbacks which when combined with annually varying, but steady, energy demand, results in renewable energy excesses or deficits. Therefore, it is essential to devise a long-term storage medium to balance their intermittent demand and supply. Hydrogen (H2) as an energy vector has been suggested as a viable method of achieving the objectives of meeting the increasing global energy demand. However, successful implementation of a full-scale H2 economy requires large-scale H2 storage (as H2 is highly compressible). As such, storage of H2 in geological formations has been considered as a potential solution where it can be withdrawn again at the larger stage for utilization. Thus, in this review, we focus on the potential use of geological formations for large-scale underground hydrogen storage (UHS) where both conventional and non-conventional UHS options were examined in depth. Also, insights into some of the probable sites, and the related examined criteria for selection were highlighted. The hydrodynamics of UHS influencing factors (including solid, fluid, and solid–fluid interactions) are summarized exclusively. In addition, the economics and reaction perspectives inherent to UHS have been examined. The findings of this study show that UHS, like other storage systems, is still in its infancy. Further research and development are needed to address the significant hurdles and research gaps found, particularly in replaceable influencing parameters. As a result, this study is a valuable resource for UHS researchers.},

	abstract = {Subsurface hydrogen (H2) storage in geological formations is of growing interest for decarbonization. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the multiphase flow involved in this process, which can have a significant impact on the recovery performance of H2. Therefore, a full-compositional modeling study was conducted to analyze potential issues and to understand the fundamental hydrodynamic mechanisms of H2 storage. We performed a range of 2D vertical simulations at the decametre scale with a very fine cell size (0.1 m) to observe the detailed flow behaviour of H2 with carbon dioxide (CO2) as cushion gas in various flow regimes. Issues such as viscous instability, capillary bypassing, gas trapping and gravity segregation are analysed here. To generalize our calculations, we have validated and applied the scaling theory in the context of subsurface H2 storage. Since this study is focused on the hydrodynamic behaviour, three dimensionless groups, including aspect factor, capillary/viscous ratio and gravity/viscous ratio were identified to correlate recovery performance between various scales in a fixed heterogeneous system. It was found that H2 could infiltrate the cushion gas in the proximity of the injectors, meaning that CO2 is not displaced away from the injectors in a piston-like fashion. As a result, the purity of the back produced H2 is much degraded, particularly in a viscous-dominated scenario. On the other hand, the injected H2 mostly accumulates at the top forming a highly restricted mixing zone with CO2 in the gravity-dominated case. The recovery performance is therefore much improved in this case. Although the gas distribution can be significantly altered by capillary forces leading to bypassed zones, the recovery performance of H2 is hardly influenced. This is because the back-produced H2 recovery is not dependent on the sweep efficiency of the gas. H2 can be back produced following the same paths which were formed during injection.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage in underground structures is an appropriate way for keeping the balance between the energy production and consumption. Indeed, excessive electrical energy can be converted, through electrolysis, to chemical energy of hydrogen molecules, which can then be temporarily stored in underground structures. Later on, when the demand for energy rises, the process can be reversed to satisfy the demand. Hydrogen has distinctive characteristics compared to other gases. It possesses good potentials for energy generation and exhibits widely different behaviors in porous media. In the present study, underground hydrogen storage (UHS) in a depleted oil reservoir was numerically simulated and the results were investigated. The UHS requires base or cushion gas to retain the reservoir pressure high enough as the hydrogen is being retrieved out of the reservoir. We herein studied gaseous forms of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and methane as candidate cushion gas. Various scenarios, in terms of the type and composition of the cushion gas flow, were simulated and the results were evaluated in terms of hydrogen recovery factor, unwanted fluid production, and hydrogen loss. Moreover, an attempt was made to present the mechanism of hydrogen behaviour based on different hydrodynamic reservoir phenomena, such as gravity segregation and overriding, under various scenarios. Our findings show that the maximum hydrogen recovery (89.7\%) was anticipated when methane was injected as the cushion gas. In the absence of any cushion gas, the hydrogen loss was estimated at 15.5\%. Prior to water breakthrough, the pressure buildup due to water injection was found to improve the hydrogen recovery in annual cycles, but the effect on the UHS performance was seen to be the opposite since after the water breakthrough.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen gas as a clean and renewable kind of energy can be considered to supply electricity demand during peak usage times. Actually, excess electricity cannot be stored in great quantities, but it can be converted to hydrogen, which can be stored and converted to electricity as a peak shaving. However, due to the very low hydrogen energy density in terms of volume, a huge capacity is needed for its storage. Therefore, underground hydrogen storage (UHS) can be evaluated as a solution. This study investigated the effect of cushion gas on underground hydrogen storage in a partially depleted gas condensate reservoir in a real case which is located in the Middle east. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time the feasibility of underground hydrogen storage in a gas condensate reservoir has been investigated. The effect of some parameters such as cushion gas type, namely; methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, condensate existence, the implementation time of storage, hydrogen injection initialization stage, and hydrogen injection/production rate was investigated on hydrogen heating value and recovery during the underground hydrogen storage operation. The results of replacing alternative gases as part of cushion gas showed that the highest amount of hydrogen recovery and purity could be obtained by injecting the nitrogen. While carbon dioxide was the most effective alternative gas to improve condensate production but in terms of hydrogen recovery and purity was not. Also, implementing hydrogen storage in the gas condensate reservoir leads to higher hydrogen recovery than dry gas reservoirs due to the trapping of alternative gases in the condensate phase. However, most of the injected carbon dioxide was produced during hydrogen production, which is unfavorable. This study shows that 60\% depletion of the gas condensate reservoir is the best condition to start underground hydrogen storage. Further, applying a hydrogen injection initialization stage indicated that the hydrogen recovery and heating value could be increased. However, it requires a detailed economic evaluation to consider the cost/benefit of initialized hydrogen loss and recovery.},

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen storage has been recognized as a key technology for storing enormous amounts of hydrogen, thus aiding in the industrial-scale application of a hydrogen economy. However, underground hydrogen storage is only poorly understood, which leads to high project risk. This research thus examined the effect of caprock availability and hydrogen injection rate on hydrogen recovery factor and hydrogen leakage rate to address some fundamental questions related to underground hydrogen storage. A three dimensional heterogeneous reservoir model was developed, and the impact of caprock and hydrogen injected rate on hydrogen underground storage efﬁciency were analysed with the model. The results indicate that both caprock and injection rate have an important impact on hydrogen leakage, and the quantities of trapped and recovered hydrogen. It is concluded that higher injection rate increases H2 leakage when caprocks are absent. In addition, lower injection rates and caprock availability increases the amount of recovered hydrogen. This work therefore provided fundamental information regarding underground hydrogen storage project assessment, and supports the decarbonisation of the energy supply chain.Cited as: Mahdi, D.S., Al-Khdheeawi, E.A., Yuan, Y., Zhang, Y., Iglauer, S.

Implementation of four annual withdrawal-injection cycles followed by one prolonged withdrawal period show that the thin gas zone is a preferred target with a final hydrogen recovery factor of 87\%. The hydrogen distribution in the subsurface follow the geological structures and is restricted by fluid saturation and displacement efficiencies. Case studies show that the pre-injection of formation gas as a cushion gas efficiently increases the ultimate hydrogen recovery, but at the cost of hydrogen purity. The injection of 30\% hydrogen-formation gas mixture results in a varying hydrogen fraction in the withdrawn gas.

For this reason, we have reviewed this cubic EoS, in order to explore the development around it and some general applications where it has been applied, including its most known modifications. So, a complete time-line of the PR EoS is presented, as a compilation of more than 200 modifications for pure compound applications and about 100 modifications for mixtures. These modifications to the PR EoS have been grouped in four main categories according to the nature of the modification: (a) by changing the dependence structure of α with temperature or the expressions for parameter a and b, (b) by introducing deviation functions (like volume translation), (c) by incorporating new parameters or terms in the equation of state, and finally (d) by modifying the mixing rules for mixture applications. Although great efforts have been made to improve accuracy and performance of the PR EoS, as demonstrated by the wide range of modifications, the necessity for further development of a universal, simple and accurate model is a rich source for research and discussion, considering the success of most of modifications is restricted to the studied properties and compounds, and therefore, they are limited to be just applied to the studied field. However, after 40 years, PR is still an invaluable and prominent tool, which will be under continuous development and research for next decades.},

Underground storage of hydrogen is established in underground salt caverns, but these have restricted geographical locations within the UK and cannot deliver the required capacity. Hydrogen storage in porous geological formations has significant potential to deliver both the capacity and local positioning. This study investigates the potential for storage of hydrogen in porous subsurface media in Scotland. We introduce for the first time the concept of the hydrogen storage play. A geological combination including reservoir, seal and trap that provides the optimum hydrogen storage reservoir conditions that will be potential targets for future pilot, and commercial, hydrogen storage projects. We investigate three conceptual hydrogen storage plays in the Midland Valley of Scotland, an area chosen primarily because it contains the most extensive onshore sedimentary deposits in Scotland, with the added benefit of being close to potential consumers in the cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. The formations assessed are of Devonian and Carboniferous age. The Devonian storage play offers vast storage capacity but its validity is uncertain due to due to a lack of geological data. The two Carboniferous plays have less capacity but the abundant data produced by the hydrocarbon industry makes our suitability assessment of these plays relatively certain. We conclude that the Carboniferous age sedimentary deposits of the D'Arcy-Cousland Anticline and the Balgonie Anticline close to Edinburgh will make suitable hydrogen storage sites and are ideal for an early hydrogen storage research project.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen stored on a large scale in porous rocks helps alleviate the main drawbacks of intermittent renewable energy generation and will play a significant role as a fuel substitute to limit global warming. This study discusses the injection, storage and production of hydrogen in an open saline aquifer anticline using industry standard reservoir engineering software, and investigates the role of cushion gas, one of the main cost uncertainties of hydrogen storage in porous media. The results show that one well can inject and reproduce enough hydrogen in a saline aquifer anticline to cover 25\% of the annual hydrogen energy required to decarbonise the domestic heating of East Anglia (UK). Cushion gas plays an important role and its injection in saline aquifers is dominated by brine displacement and accompanied by high pressures. The required ratio of cushion gas to working gas depends strongly on geological parameters including reservoir depth, the shape of the trap, and reservoir permeability, which are investigated in this study. Generally, deeper reservoirs with high permeability are favoured. The study shows that the volume of cushion gas directly determines the working gas injection and production performance. It is concluded that a thorough investigation into the cushion gas requirement, taking into account cushion gas costs as well as the cost-benefit of cushion gas in place, should be an integral part of a hydrogen storage development plan in saline aquifers.},

	abstract = {A large-scale carbon dioxide (CO2) injection pilot is ongoing at Cranfield, Mississippi, in a saline aquifer with high dissolved methane (CH4) content, employing one injection well and two observation wells. The breakthrough of CH4 and CO2 at the observation wells provides insights to phase partitioning and the multipath nature of flow through the formation. Injected CO2 is cooler than the formation temperature, making temperature another useful observation. Simulations of the first year of CO2 injection were conducted with the numerical simulator TOUGH2 and the equation of state module EOS7C, which includes CO2, CH4, and H2O, using an axisymmetric model with layering based on well logs from the injection well. Although the simplification of an axisymmetric model precludes study of formation dip or lateral heterogeneity, its simple structure enables a focus on physical processes involving the phase partitioning of CH4 and CO2, and temperature effects. Field observations that the model reproduces include the arrival of a bank of free-phase CH4 ahead of the main CO2 plume at each observation well, and non-monotonic changes in CH4 and CO2 mole fraction as a function of time, suggesting that multiple distinct flow paths exist between the injection well and the observation wells, each with its own bank of free-phase CH4 leading the CO2. Model results are compared with temperature observations made in the field with a Distributed Temperature Sensor (DTS) system, suggesting that a well-defined thermal response reached the near observation well within the seven-month monitoring period, but not the more distant observation well. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},

	abstract = {Scale effects are differences in physical behavior that manifest between a large event and a geometrically scaled laboratory model and may cause misleading predictions. This study focuses on scale effects in granular slides, important in the environment and to industry. A versatile 6 m long laboratory setup has been built following Froude similarity to investigate dry granular slides at scales varied by a factor of 4, with grain Reynolds numbers Re in the range of 10 to 10 . To provide further comparison, discrete element method simulations have also been conducted. Significant scale effects were identified; the nondimensional surface velocity increased by up to 35\%, while the deposit runout distance increased by up to 26\% from the smallest to the largest model. These scale effects are strongly correlated with Re, suggesting that interactions between grains and air are primarily responsible for the observed scale effects. This is supported by the discrete element method data, which did not show these scale effects in the absence of air. Furthermore, the particle drag force accounted for a significant part of the observed scale effects. Cauchy number scale effects caused by unscaled particle stiffness resulting in varying dust formation with scale are found to be of secondary importance. Comparisons of the laboratory data to that of other studies and of natural events show that data normalization with Re is an effective method of quantitatively comparing laboratory results to natural events. This upscaling technique can improve hazard assessment in nature and is potentially useful for modeling industrial flows.},

Especially with regard to heat supply, this technology offers a huge potential for carbon saving. One of the main targets of geothermal projects in Central Europe is the Upper Rhine Graben, which exhibits elevated subsurface temperatures and reservoirs with favorable hydraulic properties. Several decades of intensive research in the region resulted in a comprehensive understanding of the geological situation. This review study summarizes the findings relevant to deep geothermal projects and thus provides a useful working and decision-making basis for stakeholders. A total of nine geological units have been identified that are suitable for deep geothermal exploitation, comprising the crystalline basement, various sandstone formations and Mesozoic carbonates. An extensive lithostratigraphic, structural, geochemical, hydraulic and petrophysical characterization is given for each of these potential reservoirs. This paper furthermore provides an overview of the available data and geological as well as temperature models.},

The European HEATSTORE consortium includes 24 contributing partners from 9 countries, composing a mix of scientific research institutes and private companies. The Swiss consortium, developing HEATSTORE in Switzerland, involves of two industrial partners (Services Industriels de Geneva - SIG and Energie Wasser Bern - EWB) and four academic partners (Universities of Geneva, Bern, Neuchâtel and ETH Zurich), with support from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. The aims are to develop two demonstration projects for High Temperature Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (HT-ATES) in the cantons of Geneva and Bern such that industrial waste heat can be converted into a resource. This paper presents the results of the first year of activities in the Swiss projects. The activities planned cover subsurface characterization, energy system analysis, surface implementation design, legal framework improvement and business modelling to ensure the sustainability of the projects. This approach is supported by large industrial investments for subsurface characterization. Two wells, down to 1200m below surface level (bsl) are being drilled in the Geneva area to tap potential targets in the carbonate Mesozoic units and at least three additional wells, down to 500m bsl will target the Molasse sediments in the Bern area next year. These wells allow subsurface exploration and characterization and will provide data, used for detailed THMC modelling to assess the thermal energy storage potential at the two sites in Switzerland. The results of such numerical modelling are combined with energy system analysis to quantify the waste heat availability and heat demand and hence optimize the production and injection operations. The outcomes of the coupled assessments will aid in designing the integration of the new installations into the districtheating network. Legal framework improvements, based on complete technical evaluation and on the best-practice sharing with the other European partners, will be an enabling tool to accelerate the implementation of the HT-ATES systems, while business modelling helps calibrate the economic feasibility of the projects and helps industrial partners to plan future investments.},

	abstract = {The campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) contains several waste heat streams. In an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by optimizing thermal power consumption on the campus, researchers at the KIT are proposing a ‘DeepStor’ project, which will sequester waste heat from these streams in an underground reservoir during the summer months, when the heat is not required. The stored heat will then be reproduced in the winter, when the campus’s thermal power demand is much higher. This paper contains a preliminary geochemical risk assessment for the operation of this subsurface, seasonal geothermal energy storage system. We used equilibrium thermodynamics to determine the potential phases and extent of mineral scale formation in the plant’s surface infrastructure, and to identify possible precipitation, dissolution, and ion exchange reactions that may lead to formation damage in the reservoir. The reservoir in question is the Meletta Beds of the Upper Rhein Graben’s Froidefontaine Formation. We modeled scale- and formation damage-causing reactions during six months of injecting 140 °C fluid into the reservoir during the summer thermal storage season and six months of injecting 80 °C fluid during the winter thermal consumption season. Overall, we ran the models for 5 years. Anhydrite and calcite are expected mineral scales during the thermal storage season (summer). Quartz is the predicted scale-forming mineral during the thermal consumption period (winter). Within {\textasciitilde}20 m of the wellbores, magnesium and iron are leached from biotite; calcium and magnesium are leached from dolomite; and sodium, aluminum, and silica are leached from albite. These reactions lead to a net increase in both porosity and permeability in the wellbore adjacent region. At a distance of {\textasciitilde}20–75 m from the wellbores, the leached ions recombine with the reservoir rocks to form a variety of clays, i.e., saponite, minnesotaite, and daphnite. These alteration products lead to a net loss in porosity and permeability in this zone. After each thermal storage and production cycle, the reservoir shows a net retention of heat, suggesting that the operation of the proposed DeepStor project could successfully store heat, if the geochemical risks described in this paper can managed.},

	abstract = {Experimental results obtained during rapid shearing of several dry, coarse, granular materials in an annular shear cell are described. The main purpose of the tests was to obtain information that could be used to guide the theoretical development of constitutive equations suitable for the rapid flow of cohesionless bulk solids at low stress levels. The shear-cell apparatus consists of two concentric disk assemblies mounted on a fixed shaft. Granular material was contained in an annular trough in the bottom disk and capped by a lipped annular ring on the top disk. The bottom disk can be rotated at specified rates, while the top disk is loaded vertically and is restrained from rotating by a torque arm connected to a force transducer. The apparatus was thus designed to determine the shear and normal stresses as functions of solids volume fraction and shear rate.Tests were performed with spherical glass and polystyrene beads of nearly uniform diameters, spherical polystyrene beads having a bimodal size distribution and with angular particles of crushed walnut shells. The particles ranged from about ½ to 2 mm in size. At the lower concentrations and high shear rates the stresses are generated primarily by collisional transfer of momentum and energy. Under these conditions, both normal and shear stresses were found to be proportional to the particle density, and the squares of the shear rate and particle diameter. At higher concentrations and lower shear rates, dry friction between particles becomes increasingly important, and the stresses are proportional to the shear rate raised to a power less than two. All tests showed strong increases in stresses with increases in solids concentrations. The ratio of shear to normal stresses showed only a weak dependence upon shear rate, but it increased with decreasing concentration. At the very highest concentrations with narrow shear gaps, finite-particle-size effects became dominant and differences in stresses of as much as an order of magnitude were observed for the same shear rate and solids concentration.},

	abstract = {We adapt the traction-at-split-node method for spontaneous rupture simulations to the velocity-stress staggered-grid finite difference scheme. The staggered-grid implementation introduces both velocity and stress discontinuities via split nodes. The staggered traction components on the fault plane are interpolated to form the traction vector at split nodes, facilitating alignment of the vectors of sliding friction and slip velocity. To simplify the split-node partitioning of the equations of motion, spatial differencing is reduced from fourth to second order along the fault plane, but in the remainder of the grid the spatial differencing scheme remains identical to conventional spatially fourth-order three-dimensional staggered-grid schemes. The resulting staggered-grid split node (SGSN) method has convergence rates relative to rupture-time, final-slip, and peak-slip-velocity metrics that are very similar to the corresponding rates for both a partly staggered split-node code (DFM) and the boundary integral method. The SGSN method gives very accurate solutions (in the sense that errors are comparable to the uncertainties in the reference solution) when the median resolution of the cohesive zone is 4.4 grid points. Combined with previous results for other grid types and other fault-discontinuity approximations, the SGSN results demonstrate that accuracy in finite difference solutions to the spontaneous rupture problem is controlled principally by the scheme used to represent the fault discontinuity, and is relatively insensitive to the grid geometry used to represent the continuum. The method provides an efficient and accurate means of adding spontaneous rupture capability to velocity-stress staggered-grid finite difference codes, while retaining the computational advantages of those codes for problems of wave propagation in complex media.},

The method resolves the episodic intersection offset by examining the dynamic fault traction resulting from two sets of constraint equations, one for each slip direction. To verify this method, we modify two benchmark problems, hosted at Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), by allowing a branching fault to step across a main fault. The modified SCEC problem results agree with our expectations that the intersection offset scenarios are dictated by the nucleation patch location and initial fault traction. This new method comes with an open‐source finite‐element code Defmod.},

The hydromechanical coupling in the porous matrix is derived within the framework of the generalized Biot theory and the fluid flow in the fractures satisfies the lubrication equation. The presence and propagation of fluid-driven fractures is handled with the extended finite element method and the propagation of the fluid-driven fractures is governed by a mixed linear cohesive law relying on a stable mortar formalism. A comparison between numerical results and a semi-analytical solution for plane fluid-driven fractures in porous media assess the validity of the proposed model. Then, a procedure for the propagation of fluid-driven fractures on non predefined paths is detailed. In particular, the fracture reorientation angle is computed exclusively from cohesive quantities. Various numerical experiments are performed to study the interferences between neighboring fluid-driven fractures as well as the reorientation of fluid-driven fractures under complex stress conditions. Finally, the model is extended to discontinuity junctions and an application to arrays of vertical fractures initiated from horizontal wells is presented.},

	abstract = {Proppant embedment, which occurs at depths in rock formations, is a key proppant downhole mechanism which can result in rapid decline in hydrocarbon production. The current review study reveals that both rock formation characteristics and proppant characteristics significantly determine the embedment mechanism. Importantly, the review shows that embedment can occur in any formation, whatever the type of rock, leading to conductivity loss in siltstone of 78.42\%, in mudstone of 81.89\%, in conglomerate of 91.55\%, and in shale of 78.05\%. The present study investigated the importance of the creep phenomenon (a function of confinement and temperature), the percentage of clay content, and surface roughness on proppant embedment. Other dynamics, such as time, temperature and fracture fluid, can also impact the rate of proppant embedment as they help to alter the softness (young's modulus) of the fracture surface. This study reveals that curable resin-coated sand (embedment of 44 μm) is very tolerant of the embedment process compared with lightweight ceramics (113 μm) and uncoated fracture sand (106 μm). Similarly, higher proppant concentration, greater proppant size, uniform proppant distribution and a greater number of proppant layers can minimize the embedment process to a great extent, ensuring the effective extraction of oil/gas from hydraulically fractured wells. This paper also reviews some existing numerical and analytical models on proppant embedment which enable forecasting of the fracture conductivity loss undergone in downhole fracture treatments. Finally, the paper summarizes some of the case studies emphasized on proppant embedment effect and various research recommendations are suggested to minimize the proppant embedment.},

This study explores the effects of proppants and hydraulic fracture arrangement on the efficiency of geothermal development by developing a thermo-hydro-mechanical coupled model. The evolution of the fracture aperture is captured based on the Hertz contact theory and the Kozeny-Carman equation. The finite element method (FEM) is used to analyse the mechanical behaviour of the fractured system. The thermo-hydro circulated process is investigated using the unified pipe-network method (UPM). In the simulation of a doublet system embedded with propped hydraulic fractures, the increase of proppant distribution density enhances the net heat-extraction rate and reduces the thermal breakthrough time and accumulated thermal energy. The influence of reservoir properties on the heat production is further investigated. In the designing of the hydraulic stimulation, both the increase of the propped hydraulic fracture number (at least two hydraulic fractures) and the spacing promote the efficiency of geothermal development, however, the cost of the field design should be considered for optimization.},

A fracture is propagated through a two-dimensional domain, driven by the flow of a proppant-laden slurry. Modeling of the slurry flow includes the effects of proppant bridging and the subsequent flow of fracturing fluid through the packed proppant. This allows for simulation of a tip screen-out, a phenomenon in which there is a high degree of physical interaction between the rock deformation, fluid flow, and proppant transport and leads to shock formation in the solution. The numerical implementation is verified and the model is used to simulate a tip screen-out in both planar and non-planar fractures. An analysis of the results is performed for three different coupling schemes: monolithic, sequential, and loose coupling. The monolithic scheme is shown to be optimal in terms of computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy. In addition, a robust and more efficient algorithm for injection-rate controlled hydraulic fracturing simulation based on global mass conservation is presented in this article.},

The existing models either model the proppant transport physics in static predefined fracture geometry or account for the analytical models for defining the fracture propagation. Furthermore, the fluid leak-off effects are usually neglected in the hydrodynamics of proppant transport in the existing models. In the present paper, a dynamic and integrated numerical model is determined that uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique to model the fluid flow with proppant transport and Extended finite element method (XFEM) to model the fracture propagation. The results of fracture propagation were validated with the real field results and analytical models, and the results of proppant transport are validated with the experimental results. The integrated model is then used to comprehensively investigate the hydrodynamical properties that directly affect the near-wellbore stress and proppant distribution inside the fracture. The model can accurately model the proppant physics and also propose a solution to a frequent challenge faced in the petroleum industry of fracture tip screen out. Thus, using the current model allows the petroleum engineers to design the hydraulic fracturing operation successfully, model simultaneously fracture propagation and fluid flow with proppant transport and gain confidence by tracking the distribution of proppants inside the fracture accurately.},

	abstract = {Predicting the production rate and estimating the ultimate recovery are of great significance for the optimization of shale gas development. One possible reason for production decline is the width reduction of propped fractures caused by proppant deformation, embedment, crushing, and viscoelasticity of the reservoir. In order to obtain more in-depth knowledge of how these factors influence the gas production, a novel approach is proposed to simulate the processes of both hydraulic fracturing and gas production using the extended finite element method (XFEM). On the one hand, a numerical model which involves the coupled processes of deformation of the porous rock medium, fluid flow and leak-off, crack propagation, and proppant transport is proposed to obtain the proppant distribution for the hydraulic fracturing simulation. On the other hand, a coupled rock deformation and two-phase flow model considering stress-dependent fracture conductivity, crushing of proppant grains, creep of surrounding rock, gas diffusion and desorption, and influence of natural fractures is developed for the flowback and gas production simulation. The fracture closure during the shut-in and flowback process of fracturing fluid is considered. In addition, the size effects of proppant grains are investigated by using Weibull theory. After validation of the proposed model through history-matching, the sensitivity analysis of the proposed model on gas production is conducted. This study reveals that the proppant size has a dominant influence. Although proppant with larger grain sizes leads to a more permeable propped fracture, it is found that only proppant grains of proper size, not too large or too small, has the potential to achieve economic gas production due to the combined effects of size effect of the grains and “bridging out” of the proppant. The second influential factor on the gas production is the proppant concentration which is followed by the viscosity of shale formation, the Young's modulus of proppant, and the Young's modulus of shale formation. This study leads to a better understanding of proppant-related mechanisms involved in hydraulic fracturing and gas production and provides an efficient numerical tool for the prediction of well performance in field development planning.},

The governing equations are based on the momentum balance and mass conservation of the fluid. The hydro-mechanical coupling between the fracture and surrounding porous medium is fulfilled through the weak form of the governing equations. The fluid inflow within the fracture is modeled using the one-dimensional mass conservation of the injected slurry and proppant along the fracture, in which the viscosity of the slurry is dependent on the proppant concentration. The transition from the Poiseuille to Darcy flow regime is incorporated into the computational model as the proppant concentration reaches its maximum pack value. In order to represent the fracture, the extended finite element method (X-FEM) is employed by applying the appropriate enrichment functions. The fracture imposes a discontinuity in the rock displacement, as well as, the gradient of the fluid pressure in normal direction to the fracture. Finally, several numerical examples of typical hydraulic fracturing problems are simulated to investigate the behavior of the fracture propagation in the case of proppant transport and tip screen-out formation. The influence of various parameters of the proppant, such as the injection concentration and proppant size, as well as the porous medium, such as the permeability, is investigated.},

Hopper flow physical experiments and numerical simulations are conducted to study the influence of the critical material attributes and critical processing parameters on the flow pattern, arching, and throughput. The results show that (1) the preferred flow pattern, mass flow, can be achieved by controlling the material’s internal friction angle, hopper inclination, and hopper wall friction; (2) hopper arching, governed by the competing gravity-driven force against flow resistance from material internal friction and material–wall friction, can be controlled by the hopper wall friction angle and the inclination angle; and (3) flow throughput can be accurately estimated from our empirical equation with inputs of hopper outlet geometry and particle-scale to bulk-scale material attributes.

	abstract = {Numerical simulations of multistage hydraulic fracturing usually neglect poroelastic effects. However, in case of low permeability reservoirs, where hydraulic fracturing is usually carried-out using relatively low viscosity fluids and high injection rates, coupled poroelastic mechanisms need be included for better understanding of the fracturing process, which can involve rock failure and/or reactivation of natural fractures. In this paper, we present a fully coupled three-dimensional poroelastic analysis of multiple fracture propagation from horizontal wells. The numerical model uses the indirect boundary element method of displacement discontinuity for poroelastic response of the rock, the finite element method for fracture fluid flow, and the linear elastic fracture mechanics approach for fracture propagation. The model accounts for the mechanical interactions among multiple fractures, mixed-mode propagation, fluid diffusion into the reservoir matrix, and the effects of fluid diffusion on the rock mechanical response. The model is verified with analytical solutions, and numerical examples of simultaneous and sequential fracturing of single and multiple horizontal wells in the Niobrara Chalk formation are presented. The results show the created fracture network geometries are strongly influenced by the mechanical interactions among the fractures. It is also demonstrated that the poroelastic effect increases the net fracture pressure and causes a reduction in fracture volume. The poroelastic model illustrates the transient character of stress shadow, and is particularly useful for re-fracturing analysis since it readily calculates the stress variations due to reservoir depletion.},

	abstract = {Rock layering, a critical factor in determining fracture height growth, is pervasive in Longmaxi shale formation in the southwest of China. This formation has characteristics of large burial depth, low porosity and multiple bedding layers that hamper reaching the target fracture height even after increasing the pumping rate and treatment size. Hence, it becomes much significant to develop a fracture propagation model considering the effect of bedding layers on fracture height growth. This paper introduces a coupled 3-D hydraulic fracture propagation model and investigates the influence of shear displacement discontinuities along bedding planes on fracture height growth. Our model addresses rock deformation and fluid flow. Rock deformation is governed by a fully three-dimensional displacement discontinuity method (3D DDM). The fluid flow model employs a finite difference method (FDM) being able to capture fluid movement along vertical fractures and bedding planes. Additionally, a propagation criteria determines whether the fracture would penetrate bedding planes. In this paper, we selected two different fracture geometries and analyzed profiles of fracture width, pressure and two types of shear displacement discontinuities. From numerical investigations, we found that the maximum width can be obtained at the junction after the vertical fracture penetrated the bedding planes as a result of the decrement of the compressive stress acting on the bedding planes. As the fracture penetrates the bedding planes, a certain amount of fluid would leak into the planes, which leads to fracture height containment. Moreover, the slope utilized for characterizing the correlation between leak-off volume and fracture height, is regarded as a tool to identify the number of BPs that fracture penetrates through. This paper illustrates the potential application of our 3-D fracture propagation model for Longmaxi shale formation with multiple bedding layers. Shear displacements along bedding planes are regarded as a primary mechanism of fracture height containment.},

	abstract = {This study considers the problem of simultaneous propagation of multiple closely spaced hydraulic fractures in homogeneous rocks, under the limited entry condition that ensures uniform flux distribution between the fractures. In particular, the sensitivity of the results to fracture propagation regimes is investigated. There are four primary regimes of hydraulic fracture propagation that are related to interactions between two dissipation mechanisms, related to fluid viscosity and rock toughness, and a fluid storage mechanism (fracturing fluid leak-off), which can occur either inside the fracture or inside the formation. It is shown that the fracture behavior varies dramatically with respect to the fracture propagation regime. In particular, fractures that propagate in the viscosity dominated regime exhibit weak stress shadow interactions, grow predominantly radially, and develop nearly identical fracture geometries. In contrast, fractures that propagate in the toughness regime exhibit strong stress shadow interactions, grow as individual segments avoiding others that are propagating simultaneously, and develop geometrical structures resembling petals in a flower, where the overall geometry is radially uniform, but the individual fractures form non-overlapping segments of the total surface area. Results are presented for the case of Newtonian fluids with and without stress anisotropy, power-law fluids, and consider the case of fracture toughness anisotropy. Finally, the effect of fracture spacing on fracture geometry is investigated for different fracture regimes.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a phase field model for proppant-filled fractures in a poroelastic medium. The formulation of the coupled system involves four unknowns: displacements, phase field, pressure, and proppant concentration. The two-field displacement phase-field system is solved fully-coupled and accounts for crack irreversibility. This solution is then coupled to the pressure equation via a fixed-stress iteration. The pressure is obtained by using a diffraction equation where the phase-field variable serves as an indicator function that distinguishes between the fracture and the reservoir. The transport of the proppant in the fracture is modeled by using a power-law fluid system. The numerical discretization in space is based on Galerkin finite elements for displacements and phase-field, and an enriched Galerkin method is applied for the pressure equation in order to obtain local mass conservation. The concentration is solved with cell-centered finite elements. Nonlinear equations are treated with Newton’s method. Our developments are substantiated with several numerical examples in two and three dimensions.},

In this study, finite element modeling (FEM) was performed to analyze temperature distribution in biological tissue subject to a bipolar electrosurgical technique. FEM can provide detailed insight into the tissue heat transfer to reduce the collateral thermal damage and improve the safety of cautery surgical procedures. A coupled thermal-electric FEM module was applied with temperature-dependent electrical and thermal properties for the tissue. Tissue temperature was measured using microthermistors at different locations during the electrosurgical experiments and compared to FEM results with good agreement. The temperature- and compression-dependent electrical conductivity has a significant effect on temperature profiles. In comparison, the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity does not impact heat transfer as much as the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity. Detailed results of temperature distribution were obtained from the model. The FEM results show that the temperature distribution can be changed with different electrode geometries. A flat electrode was modeled that focuses the current density at the midline of the instrument profile resulting in higher peak temperature than that of the grooved electrode (105 versus 96°C).},

	abstract = {The number of instances of induced seismicity associated with hydraulic fracturing has increased over the last few years, resulting in the development of industry protocols to mitigate seismic hazard. The main focus of these protocols is “traffic-light” systems based on seismic monitoring, in which operations are modified if a specified “yellow-light” magnitude level is reached or ultimately are stopped at a “red-light” magnitude. A variety of operational changes is possible to mitigate the seismic hazard at the different traffic-light levels, including slowing injection rate or volume, skipping stages, or ultimately stopping or flowing back the well. Empirical evidence of induced-seismicity magnitudes, including microseismic-imaging projects in which no induced seismicity occurred, are inconclusive about the impact of changing volume or rate. Although the largest observed magnitudes occur at large injection volumes, significant variability in magnitudes is found for both injection rate and volume. Alternatively, a geomechanical simulation can examine pore-pressure diffusion and mechanical stresses and strains associated with hydraulic-fracture treatments and can be used to model fault activation and corresponding estimates of seismic magnitudes. These geomechanical models complement monitoring-based traffic-light systems and can be used to test various operational changes to identify a scenario that reduces seismic hazard.},

Recent studies further indicate that the earthquakes tend to nucleate over relatively short injection time scales and sufficiently far from the injection zone that triggering by either poroelastic stress changes or pore pressure diffusion is unlikely. Here, we invoke an alternative model based on recent laboratory and in situ experiments, wherein distal, unstable regions of a fault are progressively loaded by aseismic slip on proximal, stable regions stimulated by hydraulic fracturing. This model predicts that dynamic rupture initiates when the creep front impinges on a fault region where rock composition favors dynamic and slip rate weakening behavior.},

We used a combination of datasets to simulate spatially heterogeneous nuisance and damage impacts. Simulated impacts are greater in the northeast of the play and smaller in the southwest. This heterogeneity is driven by concentrations of population density. Spatially varying red-light thresholds normalized on these impacts [moment magnitude (Mw) 2.0 to 5.0] are fairer and safer than a single threshold applied over a broad area. Sensitivity tests indicate that the forecast maximum magnitude is the most influential parameter. Our method provides a guideline for traffic light protocols and managing induced seismicity risks.},

	abstract = {During the past decades, significant progress has been made in the development of induced seismicity monitoring for related human activities. Hydraulic fracturing and induced seismicity monitoring are operating procedures for safe and effective production of oil and gas from unconventional resources, particularly shales. Hydraulic fracturing can induce seismicity through fluid injection and disturbance of subsurface stress in tight reservoirs. Most seismic events associated with hydraulic fracturing exhibit magnitude of Mw ≤ 3 and are referred to as microseismicity, while a few larger-magnitude earthquakes (e.g. Mw {\textgreater} 3) could also be induced by reactivating pre-existing faults. Here, we review the current status of research concerning induced seismicity monitoring for shale hydraulic fracturing. Induced seismicity contains information relating to important subsurface characteristics, e.g. rock failure potential and seismogenic zones. Microseismic monitoring is essential for reservoir characterization, e.g. fracture geometry delineation and reservoir geomechanical analysis. It is carried out with advanced acquisition, processing, and interpretation techniques, while larger-magnitude earthquakes are mainly exploited for potential geohazard management and mitigation. Challenges and prospects associated with multi-disciplines for future research and applications of induced seismicity monitoring are identified, and it contributes to achieve safe and efficient unconventional (tight) oil and gas resource exploitation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a case study of fault reactivation and induced seismicity during multistage hydraulic fracturing in Sichuan Basin, China. The field microseismicity data delineate a fault activated near the toe of the horizontal well. The spatio-temporal characteristics of the microseismicity indicate that the seismic activity on the fault during the first three stages is directly related to the fluid injection, while after Stage 3, the seismic activity is possibly due to the relaxation of the fault. The fault‐related events have larger magnitudes and different frequency‐magnitude characteristics compared to the fracturing‐related events. Three‐dimensional (3D) fully coupled distinct element geomechanical modeling for the first two hydraulic fracturing stages and a shut‐in stage between them is performed. The modeling result generates features of microseismicity similar to that of the field data. The energy budget analysis indicates that the aseismic deformation consumes a major part of the energy. The simulated fault shear displacement is also consistent with the casing deformation measured in the field. The model is also used to investigate the impact of possible operational changes on expected seismic responses. The results show that lower injection rate and lower fluid viscosity would be helpful in reducing casing deformation but not in mitigating seismicity. Decreasing the total fluid injection volume is an effective way to mitigate the seismicity, but it may hinder the stimulation of the reservoir formation and the production of the well.},

A number of simulations were performed using the Bakken Shale data in North Dakota with a wide range of input parameters to study the impact of the input parameters on the interaction mode.

	abstract = {Multi-cluster fracturing in horizontal wells is a key technology for successful development of ultra-low permeability reservoir. The propagation of hydraulic fracture during multi-cluster fracturing is complicated, especially in shale reservoir with multiple natural fractures. The design and operation of multi-cluster fracturing requires adequate understanding of influence of different factors on hydraulic fracture propagation. Up to now, many scholars have studied the hydraulic fracture morphology in multi-cluster fracturing, but few have analyzed the effect of natural fractures on hydraulic fracture propagation during multi-cluster fracturing. In this paper, a new computationally version of the particle-based model is established by Xsite to study the fracture propagation in multi-cluster fracturing with natural fractures. The tensile strength and rock toughness are calculated, and tri-axial experiments are performed to verify the accuracy of model. Simulation results show that cluster spacing and in-situ stress difference have a significant influence on the length of the hydraulic fracture and the morphology of fracture. The length of middle fracture increases with the increase of the cluster spacing, but decreases with the increase of the in-situ stress difference during multi-cluster fracturing with three natural fractures. The enhancing of cluster spacing can reduce the deflection of left and right fractures, and the increase of the in-situ stress difference can improve the ability of middle fracturing penetrating the natural fracture. Three fracturing sequence of synchronous fracturing, two-step fracturing and sequential fracturing is simulated. The left and right fractures can always penetrate the natural fracture with different fracturing sequence. But the middle fracture shows different morphology of arresting by natural fracture (during synchronous fracturing), partially penetrating the natural fracture (during two-step fracturing) and directly penetrating the natural fracture (during sequential fracturing). Different cement strengths of natural fracture are analyzed. The increase of strength of natural fracture can enhance the ability of hydraulic fracture penetrating the natural fracture. Hydraulic fracture is arrested by weak natural fracture (shear strength of 0.5 MPa), resulting in natural fracture opening. As hydraulic fracture intersecting with strong natural fracture (shear strength of 20 MPa), the hydraulic fracture can penetrate the natural fracture directly without natural fracture opening.},

	abstract = {Complex, non-planar fracture geometry is often observed in multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. The opening of hydraulic fractures results in a disturbance of local stress, which in turn affects the propagation of the adjacent fractures (stress shadow effect). The interaction between multiple fractures is of major importance in the design of fracturing treatments. In this study, a fully-coupled three-dimensional lattice-spring code is utilized to study the interference among multiple fractures. The results indicate that simultaneous propagating fractures can move towards or away from each other, resulting in complicated non-planar geometry and branching of hydraulic fractures. In an isotropic stress field, continued fracture propagation involves reorientation into a direction normal to the initial fracture plane, leading to an S-shaped fracture geometry. Higher Young's modulus values amplify the interaction of multiple fractures, resulting in more secondary fractures normal to the initial fracture plane and the greater dimension of fracture. Treatments assuming a higher magnitude of fluid viscosity /injection rate induce more branches at the tips of the primary fracture. An adjacent layer with a low modulus restricts the height growth of fractures, whereas the lateral growth and the stress interference will be in contrast relatively enhanced. This study provides further insight into the design and optimization of multiple-stage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT:. In January 2021, highly deviated injection well, 16A(78)-32, was drilled to a total depth 10,987 ft at the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) site near Milford, Utah. After a brief hiatus, hydraulic fracturing will be carried out near the toe. The production well, 16B(78)-32, will be drilled with a trajectory designed to intersect the microseismic cloud observed during creation of these stimulated fractures. The stimulation, which aims to connect injection and production wells, was simulated with a distinct element method (DEM) based code, XSiteTM, fully coupled hydro-mechanical model with explicit representation of the discrete fracture network (DFN). The model has been calibrated by a pressure history matching of the injection tests of the pilot well, 58-32. The preliminary simulations for the current interpretation of the DFN show that the formation response to the injection is dominated by the DFN. At a pumping rate of 20 bpm for 15 minutes, sufficient increase in fluid pressure resulted in failure of some area of the DFN both in tension (opening) and shear (slip). The cases with DFN dilatancy indicate lower injection pressure. The case with higher DFN strength has smaller area of slipping fractures but larger area of open fractures. Decreasing the pumping rate to 10 bpm resulted in lower net fluid pressure but a larger stimulated volume. Increasing fluid viscosity 10 times resulted in much higher fluid pressure and more DFN failure.1. Introduction. The U.S. Department of Energy selected a location in south-central Utah near the rural community of Milford to develop and test techniques for creating, sustaining, and monitoring Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) reservoirs. This field laboratory is the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE). A pilot well, 58-32, was drilled into the low permeability granitic rock that will form the EGS reservoir. In 2017 and 2019, injection testing was carried out in three zones of well 58-32 (Xing et al., 2020). From October 2020 to January 2021, the injection well of the injection-production pair, 16A(78)-32 (refer to Figure 1), was drilled, and injection testing including DFIT (Diagnostic Fracture Injection Test) and flowback test was carried out. Within the next two years, a production well of the pair will also be drilled. Both wells of the pair are highly deviated with bottom-hole temperatures near 230°C. After a brief hiatus to analyze reservoir characterization data from well 16A(78)-32, hydraulic fracturing will be carried out near the toe of that well before drilling the second well. Production well 16B(78)-32 will be drilled with a trajectory designed to intersect the microseismic cloud produced during creation of these hydraulic fractures. A key consideration is the geometry of these "near-toe" fractures in the injection well and the need to ensure effective hydraulic communication between the two wells.},

Understanding the interaction between hydraulic fractures (HF) and pre-existing joints is of great importance to optimize the design of hydraulic fracturing operations in many applications. A three-dimensional hydro-mechanical coupled lattice-spring code was employed to investigate the interaction mechanisms under different pre-existing fracture shear strength (cohesion and friction angle), in-situ stress, angle of approach, and varying treatment parameters (fluid viscosity and injection rate). Simulation results indicate that hydraulic fractures tend to cross pre-existing joints for high magnitudes of assumed of fracture cohesion, friction angle, stress difference, approach angle, fluid viscosity, and injection rate. Three basic model hydraulic fracture-joint relationships were noted which were termed zero-joint crossing, 1-joint crossing and 2-joint crossing. For varied assumed shear strength, in-situ stress, approach angle and treatment parameters, the contribution of tensile-failure in intact rock and shear-failure on pre-existing joints tends to be enhanced or reduced, which controls the dominant observed interaction behavior (slip or crossing) as well as the variation in the resulting stimulated reservoir area.},

The state variables are defined macroscopically by evolution equations for their rates of change in terms of their present values and slip rate. Experiments may strongly suggest that one state variable is adequate or prove that one is inadequate. Analysis of steady slip governed by a single state variable in a spring and (massless) slider predict oscillations at a critical spring stiffness k = kcrit. The critical stiffness kcrit is given by a simple formula and steady slip is stable for k {\textgreater} kcrit and unstable for k {\textless} kcrit. State variable friction laws may superficially appear as a simple slip rate dependence, slip distance dependence, or time dependent static friction, depending on experiment and testing machinery. Truly complicated motion is possible in a spring-slider model if more than one state variable is used. Further consequences of state variable friction laws can include creep waves and apparent rate independence for some phenomena.},

	abstract = {Direct shear experiments on ground surfaces of a granodiorite from Raymond, California, at normal stresses of ∼6 MPa demonstrate that competing time, displacement, and velocity effects control rock friction. It is proposed that the strength of the population of points of contacts between sliding surfaces determines frictional strength and that the population of contacts changes continuously with displacements. Previous experiments demonstrate that the strength of the contacts increases with the age of the contacts. The present experiments establish that a characteristic displacement, proportional to surface roughness, is required to change the population of contacts. Hence during slip the average age of the points of contact and therefore frictional strength decrease as slip velocity increases. Displacement weakening and consequently the potential for unstable slip occur whenever displacement reduces the average age of the contacts. In addition to this velocity dependency, which arises from displacement dependency and time dependency, the experiments also show a competing but transient increase in friction whenever slip velocity increases. Creep of the sliding surface at stresses below that for steady state slip is also observed. Constitutive relationships are developed that permit quantitative simulation of the friction versus displacement data as a function of surface roughness and for different time and velocity histories. Unstable slip in experiments is controlled by these constitutive effects and by the stiffness of the experimental system. It is argued that analogous properties control earthquake instability.},

	abstract = {Electrical heating of the Alberta oil sands for the recovery of bitumen has been studied since the early 1970's(1–5). The technology has evolved as an additional technology to SAGD and surface mining. This paper describes the heat and mass transfer mechanisms associated with a specific application of electrical heating, the Electro-Thermal Dynamic Stripping Process (ETDSP ™), for the production of bitumen from the oil sands.Given that heat is created in the oil sand as a current flow through the connate water and that initially all the fluids are immobile, the end result is a pressure and temperature distribution that is characteristic of an electrical heating process. To effectively recover the heated bitumen from the oil sand requires an understanding of the heat and mass transfer mechanisms associated with the pressure and temperature distribution, as well as gravity forces. The electrical heating process changes as the oil sand increases in temperature and the bitumen is produced. This results in a dynamic process whereby the heat, mass and electromagnetic fields are strongly coupled and in a transient state throughout the entire recovery process.The dominant mechanisms of the electrical heating recovery process are presented in terms of fundamental equations and solved numerically. A 3D quasi-harmonic finite element electromagnetic model is coupled to the mass and energy equations and solved in time. A recovery strategy based on an understanding of the recovery mechanisms is presented in terms of electrode spacing, duration of heating, energy supply and favourable operating requirements.Oil sands are a mixture of sand, bitumen and water. The bitumen is defined as oil that is less than 10 API and will not flow to a well in its naturally occurring state. The Alberta Energy \&amp; Utilities Board (AEUB) estimates that given current technology, over 300 billion barrels are expected to be recovered from the Alberta oil sands. There are presently two techniques used to produce bitumen; open pit mining and in situ thermal recovery, which involves drilling wells and injecting steam to heat the bitumen allowing it to flow and be produced from a well. Of the in situ methods now used, steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is the most promising, having the advantages of lower energy requirements and higher recovery factors over other steam injection methods.In-situ thermal recovery methods as applied in oil sand deposits have the common objective of accelerating the hydrocarbon recovery process. Raising the temperature of the host formation reduces the bitumen viscosity allowing the near solid material at original temperature to flow as a liquid. These effects assist in sweeping much of the bitumen from the formation when driving agents are externally injected or when autogenously processes, such as gravity drainage, come into play.Transferring electromagnetic energy to the deposit is proving to be an effective means of supplying the necessary heat. In the electro-thermal process, electromagnetic energy is converted to heat in situ using a system of electrodes from which a current flows through the formation.},

The surface flow on a ‘non-frozen’ heap is first investigated numerically using the discrete element method. The flow profiles of the surface granular flow and the creep motion of particles in the heap are studied. It is shown that the mean velocity of the surface flow exhibits a linear relationship with the distance from the heap surface, while that of the particles in the heap decays exponentially with the distance. The existence of such a creep motion may be attributed to the variation of the porosity distribution of the heap. The granular flow on a ‘frozen’ static heap is also simulated, and compared with the one on the corresponding ‘non-frozen’ heap. The results show that the surface conditions of the heap, to some extent, affect the flow upon it. The surface flow on a static heap is then theoretically examined in detail by using a recently developed continuum model. The depth of the steady-state surface flow and its dependence on wall friction and heap width are investigated. In addition, the theoretical results are compared with the DEM simulation results and the experimental ones in the literature, and qualitatively good agreements are observed.},

The chosen constitutive model of rock employs a (strong) embedded discontinuity finite element formulation to describe cracks. The thermomechanical problem that governs the heat shock pretreatment of rocks is considered as an uncoupled problem because of a highly dominating role of the external heat influx. Two solution methods of the global problem are presented: an explicit-explicit dynamic scheme and an implicit-implicit quasi-static scheme. The model performance is tested in simulations on heterogeneous numerical rock samples subjected first to a heat shock pretreatment and then to a mechanical compression test. According to the results, the compressive strength of intact granite rock having the axial splitting failure mode can be substantially reduced by heat shock pretreatment.},

It shows that as the fracture deflates in the arrest phase, the region of dominance of the linear elastic fracture mechanics tip asymptote 𝑤∼𝑥1/2w∼x1/2w{\textbackslash}sim x{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\} of the fracture aperture 𝑤ww with distance 𝑥xx from the front shrinks to the benefit of an intermediate asymptote 𝑤∼𝑥3/4w∼x3/4w{\textbackslash}sim x{\textasciicircum}\{3/4\}. Hence only the velocity-independent 3/43/43/4 asymptote is left at the arrest–recession transition. Furthermore, with increasing receding velocity of the front, a linear asymptote 𝑤∼𝑥w∼xw{\textbackslash}sim x develops progressively at the fracture tip, with 𝑤∼𝑥3/4w∼x3/4w{\textbackslash}sim x{\textasciicircum}\{3/4\} again becoming an intermediate asymptote. These universal multiscale asymptotes for the arrest and recession phases are key to determining, in combination with a computational algorithm that can simulate the evolution of a finite fracture, the decaying stress intensity factor during arrest, the time at which the fracture transitions from arrest to recession, and the negative front velocity during recession.},

	abstract = {The classical development of neural networks has primarily focused on learning mappings between finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution.},

	abstract = {A new deep-learning-based reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework is proposed for application in subsurface flow simulation. The reduced-order model is based on an existing embed-to-control (E2C) framework and includes an auto-encoder, which projects the system to a low-dimensional subspace, and a linear transition model, which approximates the evolution of the system states in low dimension. In addition to the loss function for data mismatch considered in the original E2C framework, we introduce a physics-based loss function that penalizes predictions that are inconsistent with the governing flow equations. The loss function is also modified to emphasize accuracy in key well quantities of interest (e.g., fluid production rates). The E2C ROM is shown to be analogous to an existing ROM, POD-TPWL, which has been extensively developed for subsurface flow simulation. The new ROM is applied to oil-water flow in a heterogeneous reservoir, with flow driven by nine wells operating under time-varying control specifications. A total of 300 high-fidelity training simulations are performed in the offline stage, and the network training requires 10-12 minutes on a Tesla V100 GPU node. Online (runtime) computations achieve speedups of over a factor of 1000 relative to full-order simulations. Extensive test case results, with well controls varied over large ranges, are presented. Accurate ROM predictions are achieved for global saturation and pressure fields at particular times, and for injection and production well responses as a function of time. Error is shown to increase when 100 or 200 (rather than 300) training runs are used to construct the E2C ROM. Overall the E2C ROM is shown to provide reliable predictions with levels of perturbations in the well controls that are much larger than those used with existing POD-TPWL treatments. The current model is however limited to 2D systems, and the required number of training simulations is much larger than that for POD-based ROMs.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present a new physics informed neural network (PINN) algorithm for solving brittle fracture problems. While most of the PINN algorithms available in the literature minimize the residual of the governing partial differential equation, the proposed approach takes a different path by minimizing the variational energy of the system. Additionally, we modify the neural network output such that the boundary conditions associated with the problem are exactly satisfied. Compared to the conventional residual based PINN, the proposed approach has two major advantages. First, the imposition of boundary conditions is relatively simpler and more robust. Second, the order of derivatives present in the functional form of the variational energy is of lower order than in the residual form used in conventional PINN and hence, training the network is faster. To compute the total variational energy of the system, an efficient scheme that takes as input a geometry described by spline based CAD model and employs Gauss quadrature rules for numerical integration, has been proposed. Moreover, we note that for obtaining the crack path, the proposed PINN has to be trained at each load/displacement step, which can potentially make the algorithm computationally inefficient. To address this issue, we propose to use the concept ‘transfer learning’ wherein, instead of re-training the complete network, we only re-train the network partially while keeping the weights and the biases corresponding to the other portions fixed. With this setup, the computational efficiency of the proposed approach is significantly enhanced. The proposed approach is used to solve six fracture mechanics problems. For all the examples, results obtained using the proposed approach match closely with the results available in the literature. For the first two examples, we compare the results obtained using the proposed approach with the conventional residual based neural network results. For both the problems, the proposed approach is found to yield better accuracy compared to conventional residual based PINN algorithms.},

We employ a graph convolutional network that recognizes features of the fracturing material and a recurrent neural network that models the evolution of these features, along with a novel form of data augmentation that compensates for the modest size of our training data. We simultaneously generate predictions for qualitatively distinct material properties. Results on fracture damage and length are within 3\% of their simulated values, and results on time to material failure, which is notoriously difficult to predict even with high-fidelity models, are within approximately 15\% of simulated values.

	abstract = {Creating the optimum Complex Fracture Network (CFN) during hydraulic fracturing by propagating Hydraulic Fractures (HF) stimulating and connecting the existing Natural Fractures (NF) is of great importance to fractured shale reservoirs' development. However, it yet haven't obtained enough research. Facing this urgent demand, a comprehensive CFN configuration, and optimization numerical investigation, considering geomechanics and economic effects, is proposed. An HF propagation model is constructed coupling the Displacement Discontinuity Method (DDM) and the fluid flow function, together with a power-law probability NF pattern, to simulate the CFN propagation considering the rock and fluid mechanics. Then the CFN productivity in shale reservoirs is simulated by the Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) with shale gas flow model, in which the complexly distributed fractures and the adsorption and slippage effect of shale gas are described. Based on the above, a framework for CFN optimization is developed, in which the net present value (NPV) is adopted as the objective function to consider the economic viability. A state-of-the-art Neural Network Algorithm (NNA) is employed and further improved into a Modified Neural Network Algorithm (M-NNA) in this study, which presents 89\% optimization searching accuracy tested by the complex multi-extreme benchmark function, far better than the 28\% accuracy of the original PSO algorithm. The M-NNA is then adopted as the optimization algorithm in the CFN optimization framework. Finally, as an example, a case of CFN propagation and production is simulated under the coupling effects of geomechanical and fluid parameters, results show that the CFN provides nearly 90\% of the total gas production; furthermore, the CFN for aligning and alternating fracturing placements are simulated and optimized considering the geological and economical influence, the results demonstrate that the alternating fracturing placement constructs better CFN configuration and leads to higher economic revenue.},

	abstract = {Catastrophic failure in brittle materials is often due to the rapid growth and coalescence of cracks aided by high internal stresses. Hence, accurate prediction of maximum internal stress is critical to predicting time to failure and improving the fracture resistance and reliability of materials. Existing high-fidelity methods, such as the Finite-Discrete Element Model (FDEM), are limited by their high computational cost. Therefore, to reduce computational cost while preserving accuracy, a deep learning model, StressNet, is proposed to predict the entire sequence of maximum internal stress based on fracture propagation and the initial stress data. More specifically, the Temporal Independent Convolutional Neural Network (TI-CNN) is designed to capture the spatial features of fractures like fracture path and spall regions, and the Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Network is adapted to capture the temporal features. By fusing these features, the evolution in time of the maximum internal stress can be accurately predicted. Moreover, an adaptive loss function is designed by dynamically integrating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), to reflect the fluctuations in maximum internal stress. After training, the proposed model is able to compute accurate multi-step predictions of maximum internal stress in approximately 20 seconds, as compared to the FDEM run time of 4 h, with an average MAPE of 2\% relative to test data.},

The amount of moisture in the sample often has important effects on the physical and chemical properties of pharmaceutical solids. Properties such as flow, compaction, disintegration, dissolution, hardness and chemical stability are all influenced by moisture. In the case of lactose, as moisture content increases in the powder bed, the flowability becomes poorer as the moisture condenses on the surface and increases cohesion. The celluloses show opposite effect as compared to lactose. Here, as moisture content increases, the flow properties improve dramatically. The GDR also captures the effect of lubricant concentration on the cohesion of powders. The presence of lubricant does not play any significant impact for free flowing powders, but as powder cohesion increases, the lubricants allow for improved flowability of powders. The GDR was also used for a case study of real drug formulation. The methodology was able to evaluate the impact of humidity and lubricant concentration on the flow properties of the formulation.},

	abstract = {We investigate shear strength properties of wet granular materials in the pendular state (i.e., the state where the liquid phase is discontinuous) as a function of water content. Sand and glass beads were wetted and tested in a direct shear cell and under various confining pressures. In parallel, we carried out three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations by using an explicit equation expressing capillary force as a function of interparticle distance, water bridge volume, and surface tension. We show that, due to the peculiar features of capillary interactions, the major influence of water content over the shear strength stems from the distribution of liquid bonds. This property results in shear strength saturation as a function of water content. We arrive at the same conclusion by a microscopic analysis of the shear strength. We propose a model that accounts for the capillary force, the granular texture, and particle size polydispersity. We find fairly good agreement of the theoretical estimate of the shear strength with both experimental data and simulations. From numerical data, we analyze the connectivity and anisotropy of different classes of liquid bonds according to the sign and level of the normal force as well as the bond direction. We find that weak compressive bonds are almost isotropically distributed whereas strong compressive and tensile bonds have a pronounced anisotropy. The probability distribution function of normal forces is exponentially decreasing for strong compressive bonds, a decreasing power-law function over nearly one decade for weak compressive bonds, and an increasing linear function in the range of tensile bonds. These features suggest that different bond classes do not play the same role with respect to the shear strength.},

The aim of our study is to understand the local rheology of bulk flow at various positions in the shear band, where the system is in critical state. We develop a general(ized) rheology, in which the macroscopic friction is factorized into a product of four functions, on top of the classical rheology, each of which depends on exactly one dimensionless control parameter, quantifying the relative importance of different micro-mechanical machanisms. These four control parameters relate the time scales of shear rate , particle stiffness tk, gravity tg and cohesion tc, respectively, with the governing time scale of confining pressure tp. While is large and thus of little importance for most of the slow flow data studied, it increases the friction in critical state, where the shear rate is high and decreases friction by relaxation (creep) where the shear rate is low. tg and tk are comparable to tp in the bulk, but become more or less dominant relative to tp at the extremes of low pressure at the free surface and high pressure deep inside the bulk, respectively. The effect of wet cohesion on the flow rheology is quantified by tc decreasing with increasing cohesion. Furthermore, the proposed rheological model predicts well the shear thinning behavior both in the bulk and near the free surface; shear thinning rate becomes less near the free surface with increasing cohesion.},

	abstract = {Dry granular materials have been the subject of many investigations, while wet granular materials, which widely exist in many real-world applications, have only received limited attention. The aim of this paper is to address the missing gap in continuum modeling of wet granular materials. To study the wet granular flows, a grain-scale capillary interaction is introduced, as additional cohesive stress in the continuum-scale framework. We coupled the viscoplastic constitutive law for dry granular material and cohesion model for wet isotropic granular material to capture the behavior of wet granular materials. This combined model is implemented in a smooth particle hydrodynamics framework because the meshfree nature of this method captures the large deformation of granular flows without local grid distortion. The Wendland kernel is used as the interpolation kernel to improve numerical stability. This framework is validated by comparing numerical results with recent experimental findings for both dry and wet cases. The comparisons are illustrative of the potential of the framework to capture the behavior of granular materials across different phases. For different levels of friction and water content, the run-out dynamics and shear strength properties of granular materials in the final quasi-static regime are investigated. For granular flows on flat surfaces, compared with dry granular materials, with the introduction of surface tension in wet granular materials, it is found that there are increases in shear stresses locally and globally, enabling stronger internal forces to support structures with larger angles of repose. The surface energy-induced cohesion is found to play an important role in low friction cases compared to high friction cases. To benchmark the numerical framework presented here, granular column collapses on curved surfaces are also investigated. For flows on curved surfaces, although there are also increases in internal shear stresses, the differences in final profiles between wet granular materials and dry granular materials are not as pronounced as that on flat surfaces due to geometric constraints. The findings of this work are demonstrative of the capabilities of the smooth particle hydrodynamics method for the study of wet granular materials. This effort can serve as a step forward in the quest for a unified continuum theory and computational framework of granular material dynamics.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of thermal shock weakening of granite rock under dynamic loading. A fully 3D numerical scheme based on a combined continuum viscodamage-embedded discontinuity model and an explicit scheme to solve the underlying thermomechanical problem was developed and validated through numerical examples. First, the dynamic Brazilian disc test is simulated on intact numerical rock. Then, thermal shock-induced cracking due to a moving external heat flux boundary condition, mimicking experiments based on plasma jet treatment, is numerically predicted. Finally, numerical Brazilian disc test is conducted on the thermal shocked numerical samples. The predicted and experimental weakening effects are in good agreement demonstrating that the present modeling approach has good predictive capabilities. The practical significance of the results is that heat shock pretreatment can substantially enhance rock gravel and rubble crushing.},

	abstract = {Soil water and heat transport are two physical processes that are described by the Richardson–Richards equation and heat transport equation, respectively. Soil water and heat motion directly control transport or indirectly influence parameters. The physics-informed neural network (PINN) is a new method that combines deep learning and physical laws that approximates and learns physical dynamics better than traditional data-driven deep learning methods. In this study, we propose multiphysics-informed neural networks for soil water-heat systems, in which the soil moisture and temperature information complement each other well. With our framework, existing soil moisture neural networks are improved to reduce their dependency on the soil moisture measurement density. Furthermore, soil moisture data are employed to promote soil temperature dynamic learning and soil thermal conductivity estimation. Moreover, soil temperature data assist in recovering the nonlinearity of the soil hydraulic conductivity through hydrothermal coupling constraints, allowing better estimations of the soil water flux density. The gradient-based annealing method is applied to adapt the loss function, which satisfactorily balances the water-heat transport governing equation constraints on the neural networks. The robustness and generalizability of our framework are examined under diverse scenarios. This work demonstrates the mutual compensation of multisource data in coupled physical processes in a deep learning framework and highlights the significance of appropriate multiphysical constraints designed for nonlinear parameter recovery in PINNs.},

	abstract = {Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) are capable of finding the solution for a given boundary value problem. Here, the training of the network is equivalent to the minimization of a loss function that includes the governing (partial differential) equations (PDE) as well as initial and boundary conditions. We employ several ideas from the finite element method (FEM) to enhance the performance of existing PINNs in engineering problems. The main contribution of the current work is to promote using the spatial gradient of the primary variable as an output from separated neural networks. Later on, the strong form (given governing equation) which has a higher order of derivatives is applied to the spatial gradients of the primary variable as the physical constraint. In addition, the so-called energy form of the problem (which can be obtained from the weak form) is applied to the primary variable as an additional constraint for training. The proposed approach only required up to first-order derivatives to construct the physical loss functions. We discuss why this point is beneficial through various comparisons between different models. The mixed formulation-based PINNs and FE methods share some similarities. While the former minimizes the PDE and its energy form at given collocation points utilizing a complex nonlinear interpolation through a neural network, the latter does the same at element nodes with the help of shape functions. We focus on heterogeneous solids and check the performance of the proposed PINN model against the solution from FEM on two prototype problems: elasticity and the Poisson equation (steady-state diffusion problem). It is concluded that by properly designing the network architecture in PINN, the deep learning model has the potential to solve the unknowns in a heterogeneous domain without any available initial data from other sources. Finally, discussions are provided on the combination of PINN and data from physical FE simulations for a fast and accurate design of composite materials in future developments.},

This article is to propose a kind of coupled physics-informed neural networks (CPINNs) for the closed-loop geothermal system, which is a new coupled multi-physics PDEs and mainly consists of a framework of underground heat exchange pipelines to extract the geothermal heat from the geothermal reservoir. The approach embeds the PDEs formula into the loss function of the neural networks and the resulting networks is trained to meet the equations along with the boundary conditions, initial conditions and interface conditions. The advantage of this method is that it avoids grid generation compared with the grid based methods and it is parallel for the equations and variables. In order to improve the approximation ability of the CPINNs, we add the loss weights before some terms of the loss function. Moreover, the approximate ability of the CPINNs is demonstrated by the theoretical analysis of convergence. Finally, some numerical examples are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CPINNs intuitively.},

Here we investigate the application of PINNs to the forward solution of problems involving thermo–hydro–mechanical (THM) processes in porous media that exhibit disparate spatial and temporal scales in thermal conductivity, hydraulic permeability, and elasticity. In addition, PINNs are faced with the challenges of the multiobjective and nonconvex nature of the optimization problem. To address these fundamental issues, we (1) rewrote the THM governing equations in dimensionless form that is best suited for deep learning algorithms, (2) propose a sequential training strategy that circumvents the need for a simultaneous solution of the multiphysics problem and facilitates the task of optimizers in the solution search, and (3) leveraged adaptive weight strategies to overcome the stiffness in the gradient flow of the multiobjective optimization problem.

In PINNs, automatic differentiation is leveraged to evaluate differential operators without discretization errors, and a multitask learning problem is defined in order to simultaneously fit observed data while respecting the underlying governing laws of physics. Here, we present applications of PINNs to various prototype heat transfer problems, targeting in particular realistic conditions not readily tackled with traditional computational methods. To this end, we first consider forced and mixed convection with unknown thermal boundary conditions on the heated surfaces and aim to obtain the temperature and velocity fields everywhere in the domain, including the boundaries, given some sparse temperature measurements. We also consider the prototype Stefan problem for two-phase flow, aiming to infer the moving interface, the velocity and temperature fields everywhere as well as the different conductivities of a solid and a liquid phase, given a few temperature measurements inside the domain. Finally, we present some realistic industrial applications related to power electronics to highlight the practicality of PINNs as well as the effective use of neural networks in solving general heat transfer problems of industrial complexity. Taken together, the results presented herein demonstrate that PINNs not only can solve ill-posed problems, which are beyond the reach of traditional computational methods, but they can also bridge the gap between computational and experimental heat transfer.},

We present a multiphysics-informed deep neural network machine learning method for estimating space-dependent hydraulic conductivity, hydraulic head, and concentration fields from sparse measurements. In this approach, we employ individual deep neural networks (DNNs) to approximate the unknown parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) and states (e.g., hydraulic head and concentration) of a physical system. Next, we jointly train these DNNs by minimizing the loss function that consists of the governing equations residuals in addition to the error with respect to measurement data. We apply this approach to assimilate conductivity, hydraulic head, and concentration measurements for the joint inversion of these parameter and states in a steady-state advection–dispersion problem. We study the accuracy of the proposed data assimilation approach with respect to the data size (i.e., the number of measured variables and the number of measurements of each variable), DNN size, and the complexity of the parameter field. We demonstrate that the physics-informed DNNs are significantly more accurate than the standard data-driven DNNs, especially when the training set consists of sparse data. We also show that the accuracy of parameter estimation increases as more different multiphysics variables are inverted jointly.},

This includes improving understanding of the stimulation of crystalline rock to create appropriate flow pathways, and the ability to effectively simulate both the stimulation and the flow and transport processes in the resulting fracture network. The project is performing intensively monitored rock stimulation and flow tests at the 10-m scale in an underground research laboratory. Data and observations from the field test are compared to simulations to understand processes and to build confidence in numerical modeling of the processes. In Experiment 1, we examined hydraulic fracturing an underground test bed at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, at a depth of approximately 1.5 km. We drilled eight sub-horizontal boreholes in a well-characterized phyllite. Six of the boreholes were instrumented with many sensor types to allow careful monitoring of stimulation events and flow tests, and the other two boreholes were used for water injection and production. We performed a number of stimulations and flow tests in the testbed. Our monitoring systems allowed detailed observations and collection of numerous data sets of processes occurring during stimulation and during dynamic flow tests. Long-term ambient temperature and chilled water flow tests were performed in addition to many tracer tests to examine system behavior. Data were rapidly analyzed, allowing adaptive control of the tests. Numerical simulation was used to answer key experimental design questions, to forecast fracture propagation trajectories and extents, and to analyze and evaluate results. Many simulations were performed in near-real-time in conjunction with the field experiments, with more detailed process study simulations performed on a longer timeframe. Experiment 2 will examine hydraulic shearing in a test bed being built at the SURF at a depth of about 1.25 km in amphibolite under a different set of stress and fracture conditions than Experiment 1. Five sets of fracture orientations were considered in design, and three orientations seem to be consistently observed.},

Therefore, this study focuses on the field-scale investigation of an Advanced Geothermal Energy Storage in the low-temperature Illinois basin. A systematic preliminary data analysis was conducted to probe thermal energy storage properties of the subsurface. A full-scale field test was performed to delineate the subsurface thermal processes. Results from the field test were used to calibrate a two-dimensional axisymmetric numerical model for a single push/pull well. Various operational schemes were simulated for using the validated numerical model. The results indicated that the energy storage efficiency might reach up to 82\% and the extracted fluids could generate an electrical power of 5.74 MW in five years for a simultaneous monthly injection and production scheme with an initial 90 days charging period.

	abstract = {Using an interdisciplinary approach, this paper reviews current knowledge in the field of natural hydrogen. For the first time, it combines perspectives on hydrogen from the literature of the former Eastern bloc with that of the West, including rare hardcopies and recent studies. Data are summarized and classified in three main sections: hydrogen as a free gas in different environments, as inclusions in various rock types, and as dissolved gas in ground water. This review conclusively demonstrates that molecular hydrogen is much more widespread in nature than was previously thought. Hydrogen has been detected at high concentrations, often as the major gas, in all types of geologic environment. A critical evaluation of all the proposed mechanisms regarding the origin of natural hydrogen shows that a deep-seated origin is potentially the most likely explanation for its abundance in nature. By combining available data, an estimate of 23 Tg/year for the total annual flow of hydrogen from geologic sources is proposed. This value is an order of magnitude greater than previous estimate but most likely still not large enough to account for recently discovered worldwide diffusive seepages. Hydrogen could play a critical role in mechanisms taking place in both the shallow and deep geospheres and it can influence a very wide range of natural phenomena. Hydrogen is an essential energy source for many microorganisms. Sampling for hydrogen can be a useful tool in studying natural environments, geologic mapping, monitoring of earthquakes, plotting fault traces and resource exploration. Hydrogen of geologic origin has the potential to become the renewable energy source of the future, with exploratory projects ongoing at the present time. The topic of natural hydrogen is therefore relevant from many different perspectives.},

Significant concentrations of molecular hydrogen (H2) were detected, notably around the bays. These measurements suggest that Carolina bays are the surficial expression of fluid flow pathways for hydrogen gas moving from depth to the surface. The potential mechanisms of H2 production and transport and the geological controls on the fluid migration pathways are discussed, with reference to the hypothesis that Carolina bays are the result of local collapses caused by the alteration of rock along the deep pathways of H2 migrating towards the surface. The present H2 seepages are comparable to those in similar structures previously observed in the East European craton.},

We report and compare the geological and environmental setting; seepage mode (dry gas/associated with water); co-released gases; seep rates and areal fluxes; temporal variation; seep structure; gas source; and composition. Seep characteristics are determined by local geological and hydrological conditions, specifically whether hydrogen gas is seeping through soils and unconsolidated sediments, fractured bedrock or into water. Hydrogen is typically co-emitted with other gases (CO2, CH4, N2) with CH4, the most common co-emitted gas. The structural controls on seep location and characteristics are similar between hydrogen and CO2 seeps. However, compared to CO2, hydrogen is more readily dispersed when mixing with air and hydrogen is more prone to being consumed or transformed via biotic or abiotic reactions, and so the quantity of leaked hydrogen can be greatly attenuated before seeping. Monitoring approaches should therefore be tailored to the local geology and hydrological conditions, and monitoring approaches to detect hydrogen and associated gases would be appropriate.},

The authoring committee was not asked to recommend whether uranium mining should be permitted, or to consider the potential benefits to the state were uranium mining to be pursued. It also was not asked to compare the relative risks of uranium mining to the mining of other fuels such as coal.

	abstract = {Maintaining global warming well below 2 °C, as stipulated in the Paris Agreement, will require a complete overhaul of the world energy system. Hydrogen is considered to be a key component of the decarbonization strategy for large parts of the transport system, as well as some heavy industries. Today, about 96\% of current hydrogen production comes from the steam reforming of coal or natural gas (labelled black and grey hydrogen, respectively). If hydrogen is to become a solution, then black and grey hydrogen need to be replaced by a low-carbon option. One method that has received much attention is to produce so-called green hydrogen by coupling water electrolysis with renewable energies. However, green hydrogen is expensive and energy-intensive to produce. Here, we explore an alternative option and highlight the benefits of rock-based hydrogen (white and orange) compared with classic electrolysis-based technologies. We show that the exploitation of native hydrogen and its combination with carbon sequestration has the potential to fuel a large part of the energy transition without the substantial energy and raw material cost of green hydrogen.},

However, sand and clay have many common properties; therefore arose the idea to extend the hypoplastic model to clay. The proposed model is able to describe the behaviour of cohesive soils with the incorporation of an appropriate structure tensor into the constitutive equation. This tensor is a stress-like internal parameter, also called back stress. This enables us to describe the behaviour of cohesive soils with the same material parameters for several states of consolidation and also to model barotropy and pycnotropy of sand. Numerical simulations of element tests are performed in order to check the performance of this hypoplastic model. Experimental data obtained with normally and overconsolidated clay and sand specimens with various densities are taken for comparison, and it is shown that the model is capable of describing the material behaviour of clay and sand. The determination of the material constants, the calibration method, is also presented in this paper.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy production is limited by the fluctuations limiting their application. Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is one possible alternative to reduce the gap between supply and demand by storing the energy converted to hydrogen as a carrier and store it during surplus to produce it during high demand periods. The hydrogen is stored in the subsurface in geological formations containing the gas and is injected/produced via wells. There is a lack of experience associated with this technology and only a small number of projects worldwide. There are several mechanisms that can compromise the integrity of the well and generate leakage of the stored gas. This paper aims to introduce the challenges associated with well integrity of UHS. Mechanisms that can compromise well integrity and generate leaks include microbial corrosion, hydrogen blistering hydrogen-induced cracking and hydrogen embrittlement, cement degradation, elastomer failure, and caprock sealing failure. Propose well completion criteria, recommendation, and materials selection for newly constructed wells or existing wells. A comparison with more developed storage technologies aims to provide a better understanding of the limitations of hydrogen storage by comparing it to carbon dioxide (carbon capture and storage) and methane (underground gas storage). Finally, evaluation and monitoring techniques are required to see the influence of hydrogen on well integrity. Future research and development will reduce the uncertainties and limitations associated with UHS increasing its feasibility and implementation.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.10.008},
	abstract = {The dissolution rates of olivine have been considered by a plethora of studies in part due to its potential to aid in carbon storage and the ease in obtaining pure samples for laboratory experiments. Due to the relative simplicity of its dissolution mechanism, most of these studies provide mutually consistent results such that a comparison of their rates can provide insight into the reactivity of silicate minerals as a whole. Olivine dissolution is controlled by the breaking of octahedral M2+-oxygen bonds at or near the surface, liberating adjoining SiO44− tetrahedra to the aqueous fluid. Aqueous species that adsorb to these bonds apparently accelerate their destruction. For example, the absorption of H+, H2O and, at some conditions, selected aqueous organic species will increase olivine dissolution rates. Nevertheless, other factors can slow olivine dissolution rates. Notably, olivine dissolution rates are slowed by lowering the surface area exposed to the reactive aqueous fluid, by for example the presence and/or growth on these surfaces of either microbes or secondary phases. The degree to which secondary phases decelerate rates depends on their ability to limit access of the reactive aqueous fluids to the olivine surface. It seems likely that these surface area limiting processes are very significant in natural systems, lowering olivine surface reactivity in many environments compared to rates measured on cleaned surfaces in the laboratory. A survey of the literature suggests that the major factors influencing forsteritic olivine dissolution rates are 1) pH, 2) water activity, 3) temperature, and 4) mineral-fluid interfacial surface area. Evidence suggests that the effects of aqueous inorganic and organic species are relatively limited, and may be attributed at least in part to their influence on aqueous solution pH. Moreover, the observed decrease in rates due to the presence of secondary mineral coatings and/or the presence of microbes can be attributed to their ability to decrease olivine surface area directly exposed to the reactive aqueous fluid. As the reactivity of forsterite surfaces are spatially heterogeneous, its surface area normalized rates will tend to decrease as it dissolves even in the absence of a mineral or bacterial coating. Each of these factors limits and or influences the application of forsterite dissolution to 1) enhanced weathering efforts, 2) mineral carbonation, and 3) the low temperature generation of hydrogen or hydrocarbons via the oxidation of its divalent iron.},

However, natural mantle peridotites commonly contain not only olivine but also orthopyroxene and/or clinopyroxene, which have effects that are not well understood. The present study investigated the reactions in H2O-olivine/orthopyroxene-CO2 systems by performing hydrothermal experiments in 0.5 M NaHCO3 solutions at 300 °C and 10 MPa. The yields of H2 and HCOOH initially were first suppressed in the presence of orthopyroxene; however, after orthopyroxene consumption, the rate of H2 production increased significantly. H2 yield increased to 348.3 mmol/kgmineral in 120 h with the presence of 20 wt\% orthopyroxene at the beginning of the reaction. The initial suppression of H2 generation was due to incorporation of more Fe(II) into serpentine [(Mg,Fe)3Si2O5(OH)4] in the high SiO2(aq) concentration system. The presence of orthopyroxene also dramatically accelerated serpentine formation. In contrast, magnesite [(Mg,Fe)CO3] formation was inhibited upon addition of orthopyroxene, which also contributed to the release of Fe(II). Therefore, peridotite containing ≤20 wt\% of pyroxenes is more suitable for long-term H2 production than pure olivine. When considering the reaction output of a water-peridotite-CO2 system, controlling the percentage of pyroxenes in the starting mineral may be more important than expected.},

	abstract = {Wind and solar photovoltaic electricity production have already reached very low levels of levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Electrolyzers have already reached high efficiencies which are further improving, while costs are dramatically reducing. They are commercial products. Green hydrogen (H2) is the product of excess wind and solar electricity, specifically electricity that will be otherwise wasted, without the huge energy storage needed presently almost completely missing. By growing the installed capacity of wind and solar power plants, there will be a non-dispatchable production by wind and solar more often in excess, but sometimes also in defect, of the grid demand, in presence of limited energy storage. H2 is one of the key energy storage technologies needed to ensure grid stability. Production of H2 above what is needed to stabilize the grid significantly helps in applications such as land, and sea but especially air transport where the storage of energy onboard in a fuel is preferable to the storage of energy as electricity into a battery. The engineered diagenesis for H2 is unlikely better than green hH2. Apart from being a nice idea to be proven workable, with a technology readiness level (TRL) presently of zero, and thus impossible to be objectively compared with commercial products, the engineered diagenesis for H2, even if possible, also does not help with non-dispatchable renewable energy production. The concept may also have negative environmental aspects similar to fracking which have not been considered yet, and also bear huge economic costs in addition to environmental. Here we review the pros and cons of this novel technology, which once proven workable, which is not the case yet, should be considered as a possible way to complement rather than replace green H2 production.},

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) in initially brine-saturated deep porous rocks is a promising large-scale energy storage technology, due to hydrogen’s high specific energy capacity and the high volumetric capacity of aquifers. Appropriate selection of a feasible and safe storage site vitally depends on understanding hydrogen transport characteristics in the subsurface. Unfortunately there exist no robust experimental analyses in the literature to properly characterise this complex process. As such, in this work, we present a systematic pore-scale modelling study to quantify the crucial reservoir-scale functions of relative permeability and capillary pressure and their dependencies on fluid and reservoir rock conditions. To conduct a conclusive study, in the absence of sufficient experimental data, a rigorous sensitivity analysis has been performed to quantify the impacts of uncertain fluid and rock properties on these upscaled functions. The parameters are varied around a base-case, which is obtained through matching to the existing experimental study. Moreover, cyclic hysteretic multiphase flow is also studied, which is a relevant aspect for cyclic hydrogen-brine energy storage projects. The present study applies pore-scale analysis to predict the flow of hydrogen in storage formations, and to quantify the sensitivity to the micro-scale characteristics of contact angle (i.e., wettability) and porous rock structure.},

When hydrogen combines with oxygen, there is no generation of carbon dioxide, no production of cyclic hydro-carbons, no sulfur oxides (SOx), no nitrogen oxides (NOx), no ozone cogeneration. It seems that hydrogen, along with efficient energy production, solves many of our pollution problems, from urban air pollution to global warming. In the so-called Hydrogen Age of the future (Holland and Provenzano 2007), H2 will be mainly produced by the electrolysis of water using electricity that itself is derived from renewable energy sources or nuclear power plants. Steam methane reforming (a catalyzed reaction at high temperature where CH4 is combined with water to produce CO2 and H2) will only be acceptable as a source of H2 if it is associated with low-cost CO2 storage. But, in this future energy landscape, what is the role of naturally occurring hydrogen, sometimes referred to as native hydrogen?},

	abstract = {Native hydrogen (H2) may represent a new carbon free-energy resource, but to date there is no specific exploration guide to target H2-fertile geological settings. Here, we present the first soil gas survey specifically designed to explore H2 migration in a region where no surface seepage has been documented so far. We choose the Pyrenean orogenic belt and its northern foreland basin (Aquitaine, France) as a test site for our strategy. The presence of mantle rocks at shallow depth ({\textless}10 km depth) under the Mauléon Basin connected to the surface by major faults is considered as preliminary requisites for H2 generation and drainage. On this basis, more than 1,100 in situ soil gas analysis (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, H2S, and 222Rn) were performed at ∼1 m depth at the regional scale along a 10 × 10 km grid spanning over 7,500 km2. The analysis campaign reveals several areas of high occurrence to the north of the Mauléon Basin where H2, CO2, and 222Rn concentrations exceed 1,000 ppmv, 10 vol\%, and 50 kBq m−3, respectively. Most of these hot spots are located along the North Pyrenean Frontal Thrust and other related faults rooted in the mantle body. These results, together with evidence from the literature of fluid migration at depth, suggest that H2 may be sourced from mantle rocks serpentinization and carried to the surface along major thrusting faults. Traps containing hydrogen remain unidentified up to now but the presence of salt-related structures (diapirs) near these hot spots is considered encouraging.},

	abstract = {Offshore the emissions of dihydrogen are highlighted by the smokers along the oceanic ridges. Onshore in situ measurements in ophiolitic contexts and in old cratons have also proven the existence of numerous H2 emissive areas. When H2 emanations affect the soils, small depressions and vegetation gaps are observed. These depressions, called fairy circles, have similarities with the pockmark and vent structures recognized for long time in the sea floor when natural gas escapes but also differences. In this paper we present a statistic approach of the density, size, and shape of the fairy circles in various basins. New data from Brazil and Australia are compared to the existing database already gathered in Russia, USA, and again Brazil. The comparison suggests that Australia could be one of the most promising areas for H2 exploration, de facto a couple of wells already found H2, whereas they were drilled to look for hydrocarbons. The sum of areas from where H2 is seeping overpasses 45 km2 in Kangaroo Island as in the Yorke Peninsula. The size of the emitting structures, expressed in average diameter, varies from few meters to kilometers and the footprint expressed in \% of the ground within the structures varies from 1 to 17\%. However, globally the sets of fairy circles in the various basins are rather similar and one may consider that their characteristics are homogeneous and may help to characterize these H2 emitting zones. Two kinds of size repartitions are observed, one with two maxima (25 m and between 220 m ± 25\%) one with a simple Gaussian shape with a single maximum around 175 m ± 20\%. Various geomorphological characteristics allow us to differentiate depressions of the ground due to gas emissions from karstic dolines. The more relevant ones are their slope and the ratio diameter vs. depth. At the opposite of the pockmark structures observed on the seafloor for which exclusion zones have been described, the H2 emitting structures may intersect and they often growth by coalescence. These H2 emitting structures are always observed, up to now, above Archean or Neoproterozoic cratons; it suggests that anoxia at the time the sedimentation and iron content play a key role in the H2 sourcing.},

	abstract = {A geochemical study of gas coming from three wells in northeastern Kansas supplements previous studies from the 1980s and points to a persistent regional phenomenon of H2 production. In 2008, a new well showed, just after drilling, a free gas phase with more than 80 mole \% of H2, followed by water production associated with gas. This gas is mainly composed of N2, He, H2, and occasionally CH4, with changing proportions through time. A drastic decrease in H2 at the well was observed since the aquifer is produced, along with occasional recharges in H2 evidenced notably in the early phases of gas sampling. We demonstrate that this evolution of gas composition is closely associated to the well completion story. Accordingly, two distinct origins of H2 are proposed: (1) deep crustal H2: water reduction associated to iron oxidation in the Precambrian basement; (2) reactions occurring in the tubing, primarily attributed to high contents of reduced iron and/or dissolved organic carbon (DOC = 4.1 mg L−1) in the water. The low δD values averaging −760‰ are attributed to a low temperature process, possibly a re-equilibration with water. Furthermore, the suggested origins are supported by the observed gas associations: (a) deep crustal H2 with radiogenic gases (4He and 40Ar) and metamorphic N2 (δ15N averaging +2.5‰); (b) surficial H2 with methane produced in the sedimentary aquifer and the tubing by methanogenic organisms.},

	abstract = {Recent exploratory wells in Mali (Bourabougou field) targeting natural hydrogen were a success and provide a new understanding of a first test well exploited by PETROMA (Bougou-1), and a comprehension of continental hydrogen functioning systems. Based on extensive gas data of a pioneer well and preliminary geochemical data obtained from a dozen exploratory wells in the vicinity, it is possible to confirm the presence of an extensive hydrogen field featuring at least five stacked reservoir intervals containing significant hydrogen that cover an estimated area well superior to 8 km in diameter. Results underline the potential economic interest of future natural hydrogen exploitation in continental onshore areas. A “hydrogen system” is presented with a kitchen of generation in the cratonic basement. The relatively pure hydrogen reservoirs are associated with traces of methane, nitrogen and helium. The geological stratigraphic accumulation of hydrogen is linked to the presence of multi overlaid doleritic sills and aquifers that seem to play a role to disable upward gas migration and leakage. The occurrence of a mixture of gas and water acting with an artesian activity confirms the presence of over-pressured fluids. This results in a geyser-type eruptive diphasic surface fluid in many of the wells. The “gas lift” system and the presence of traces of highly unstable carbon monoxide is linked to a recent hydrogen gas charge to reservoirs from underground aquifers, erupting with associated water. The Mali wells underscore the non-fossil source of hydrogen gas and presents features of a sustainable energy. The current estimate of its exploitation price is much cheaper than manufactured hydrogen, either from fossil fuels or from electrolysis.},

	abstract = {The emission of abiotic methane (CH4) into the atmosphere from low temperature serpentinization in ophiolitic rocks is documented to date only in four countries, the Philippines, Oman, New Zealand, and Turkey. Serpentinization produces large amounts of hydrogen (H2) which in theory may react with CO2 or CO to form hydrocarbons (Fischer–Tropsch Type synthesis, FTT). Similar mechanisms have been invoked to explain the CH4 detected on Mars, so that understanding flux and exhalation modality of ophiolitic gas on Earth may contribute to decipher the potential degassing on Mars. This work reports the first direct measurements of gas (CH4, CO2) flux ever done on onshore ophiolites with present-day serpentinization. We investigated the Tekirova ophiolites at Çirali, in Turkey, hosting the Chimaera seep, a system of gas vents issuing from fractures in a 5000m2 wide ophiolite outcrop. At this site at least 150–190t of CH4 is annually released into the atmosphere. The molecular and isotopic compositions of C1–C5 alkanes, CO2, and N2 combined with source rock maturity data and thermogenic gas formation modelling suggested a dominant abiotic component ({\textasciitilde}80–90\%) mixed with thermogenic gas. Abiotic H2-rich gas is likely formed at temperatures below 50°C, suggested by the low deuterium/hydrogen isotopic ratio of H2 (δDH2: −720‰), consistent with the low geothermal gradient of the area. Abiotic gas synthesis must be very fast and effective in continuously producing an amount of gas equivalent to the long-lasting ({\textgreater}2 millennia) emission of {\textgreater}100tCH4yr−1, otherwise pressurised gas accumulation must exist. Over the same ophiolitic formation, 3km away from Chimaera, we detected an invisible microseepage of abiotic CH4 with fluxes from 0.07 to 1gm−2d−1. On Mars similar fluxes could be able to sustain the CH4 plume apparently recognised in the Northern Summer 2003 (104 or 105tyr−1) over the wide olivine bedrock and outcrops of hydrated silicates in the Syrtis Major and Nili Fossae; just one seep like Chimaera or, more realistically, a weak, spatially sporadic microseepage, would be sufficient to maintain the atmospheric CH4 level on Mars.},

Using a series of geochemical proxies, a model to describe variable H2 concentrations in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) hot springs is presented. Interaction between water and crustal iron minerals yields H2 that partition into the vapour phase during decompressional boiling of ascending hydrothermal fluids. Variable vapour input leads to differences in H2 concentration among springs. Analysis of 50 metagenomes from a variety of YNP springs reveals that genes encoding oxidative hydrogenases are enriched in communities inhabiting springs sourced with vapour-phase gas. Three springs in the Smokejumper (SJ) area of YNP that are sourced with vapour-phase gas and with the most H2 in YNP were examined to determine the fate of H2. SJ3 had the most H2, the most 16S rRNA gene templates and the greatest abundance of culturable hydrogenotrophic and autotrophic cells of the three springs. Metagenomics and transcriptomics of SJ3 reveal a diverse community comprised of abundant populations expressing genes involved in H2 oxidation and carbon dioxide fixation. These observations suggest a link between geologic processes that generate and source H2 to hot springs and the distribution of organisms that use H2 to generate energy.},

The dataset involves {\textasciitilde}1000 natural gas samples from 470 wells in both sedimentary and non-sedimentary basins with reservoir rocks ranging in age from the Neoarchean to Cenozoic. Pathways to H2 formation can involve either organic matter intermediates and its association with biogenic natural gas or chemical synthesis and its presence in abiogenic natural gas. The latter reaction pathway generally leads to H2-rich ({\textgreater}10 mol\% H2) gas in non-sedimentary rocks. Abiogenic H2 petroleum systems are described within concepts of source–migration–reservoir–seal but exploration approaches are different to biogenic natural gas. Rates of abiogenic H2 generation are governed by the availability of specific rock types and different mineral catalysts, and through chemical reactions and radiolysis of accessible water. Hydrogen can be differently trapped compared to hydrocarbon gases; for example, pore space can be created in fractured basement during abiogenic reactions, and clay minerals and evaporites can act as effective adsorbents, traps and seals. Underground storage of H2 within evaporites (specifically halite) and in depleted petroleum reservoirs will also have a role to play in the commercial exploitation of H2. Estimated H2 production rates mainly from water radiolysis in mafic–ultramafic and granitic rocks and serpentinisation of ultramafic–mafic rocks gives a H2 inferred resource potential between {\textasciitilde}1.6 and {\textasciitilde}58 MMm3 year−1 for onshore Australia down to a depth of 1 km. The prediction and subsequent identification of subsurface H2 that can be exploited remains enigmatic and awaits robust exploration guidelines and targeted drilling for proof of concept.},

	abstract = {High concentrations of hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) have been detected in shallow open-hole exploration wells surrounding the Neoarchean Frog's Leg gold camp in the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia. After corrections for modern air contaminants and excess nitrogen (N2) the Boomer deposit gases contain: 19.9–68.7 mol\% H2; 28.7–76.9 mol\% CH4; 0.47–1.6 mol\% heavier hydrocarbons (C2–C5), which follow an Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution; 0.11–3.3 mol\% carbon dioxide (CO2); and 0.69–1.87 mol\% helium (He). The isotopic composition of the gas components was further investigated: helium has 3He/4He ratios of 1.82–3.33 × 10−8 (from 0.013 to 0.024 RA, where RA is the atmospheric value) indicating a purely crustal origin; H2 has δ2H between −781.3‰ and − 759.5‰; and CH4 has δ13C between −20.3‰ and − 2.42‰ and δ2H between −382.5‰ and − 342.2‰. The C2–C5 gaseous hydrocarbons are commonly depleted in 13C (up to 22.75‰ for ethane) and enriched in 2H (up to 117.3‰ for iso-butane) compared to methane, while a carbon isotope reversal is observed between methane and ethane. The molecular and isotopic characteristics of the gas are consistent with 1) H2 generation controlled by radiolytic reactions within basic and felsic igneous rocks and by redox reactions including serpentinization in mafic-ultramafic lithologies, and 2) methane and C2+ gaseous hydrocarbons produced by interaction of H2 with a single carbon source (mainly CO2) most likely in Fischer-Tropsch type reactions. Using the H2–CH4 hydrogen isotopic fractionations as a geothermometer, isotopic equilibrium temperatures are calculated between 42 °C and 57 °C, which based on the modern geotherm represents a depth of {\textasciitilde}1.4–2.7 km, corresponding to the Gleesons Basalt beneath the Frog's Leg gold camp. The free gases sampled from exploration wells in the Boomer deposit, Frog's Leg gold camp represent the first positive identification of abiogenic natural gas in Australia, with gas compositions similar to abiogenic gases previously reported from overseas Archean cratons. Interestingly, CH4-rich gases preserved in fluid inclusions associated with some of the region's lode gold deposits have distinctly different isotopic characteristics, suggesting that methane production has occurred by different pathways over a period from the Neoarchean to present day in the Yilgarn Craton.},

	abstract = {The exposure of mantle peridotite to water at crustal levels leads to a cascade of interconnected dissolution-precipitation and reduction-oxidation reactions-a process referred to as serpentinization. These reactions have major implications for microbial life through the provision of hydrogen (H 2 ). To simulate incipient serpentinization under well-constrained conditions, we reacted centimeter-sized pieces of uncrushed harzburgite with chemically modified seawater at 300 °C and 35 MPa for ca. 1.5 yr (13 441 h), monitored changes in fluid chemistry over time, and examined the secondary mineralogy at the termination of the experiment. Approximately 4 mol\% of the protolith underwent alteration forming serpentine, accessory magnetite, chlorite, and traces of calcite and heazlewoodite. Alteration textures bear remarkable similarities to those found in partially serpentinized abyssal peridotites. Neither brucite nor talc precipitated during the experiment. Given that the starting material contained {\textasciitilde}4 times more olivine than orthopyroxene on a molar basis, mass balance requires that dissolution of orthopyroxene was significantly faster than dissolution of olivine. Coupled mass transfer of dissolved Si, Mg, and H + between olivine and orthopyroxene reaction fronts was driven by steep activity gradients and facilitated the precipitation of serpentine. Hydrogen was released in significant amounts throughout the entire experiment; however, the H 2 release rate decreased with time. Serpentinization consumed water but did not release significant amounts of dissolved species (other than H 2 ) suggesting that incipient hydration reactions involved a volume increase of {\textasciitilde}40\%. The reduced access of water to fresh olivine surfaces due to filling of fractures and coating of primary minerals with alteration products led to decreased rates of serpentinization and H 2 release. While this concept might seem at odds with completely serpentinized seafloor peridotites, reaction-driven fracturing offers an intriguing solution to the seemingly self-limiting nature of serpentinization. Indeed, the reacted sample revealed several textural features diagnostic of incipient reaction-driven fracturing. We conclude that fracturing must have far reaching impacts on the rates of serpentinization and H 2 release in peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems.},

	abstract = {Interactions of CO2-rich aqueous fluids with mantle peridotite have major implications for geochemical budgets and microbial life in the shallow oceanic lithosphere through the formation of carbonate minerals and reduced carbon species. However, the underlying mechanisms controlling the transformation of CO2 to carbonates in ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems remain incompletely understood. A long-term laboratory experiment was conducted at 300°C and 35MPa to investigate serpentinization and carbonate formation pathways during hydrothermal alteration of peridotite. Powdered harzburgite was initially reacted with a Ca-rich aqueous fluid for 14,592h (608days) and changes in fluid composition were monitored with time. Once the system reached a steady state, a CO2(aq)-rich fluid was injected and allowed to react with the system for 5907h (246days). Fluid speciation and mineral analyses suggest that serpentinization of harzburgite in the CO2-poor system led to the precipitation of serpentine, brucite, magnetite, and minor calcite, in addition to other minor phases including chlorite and sulfur-poor Ni sulfides. The addition of the CO2(aq)-rich fluid caused dolomite, Ca-rich dolomite, and high-Mg calcite to form at the expense of olivine, calcite, and brucite, while serpentine remained unreactive. Replacement textures and mineral assemblages mimic those documented in carbonate-altered seafloor serpentinites, particularly those from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Iberia Margin. In contrast to thermodynamic predictions, magnesite did not form in the experiment because the dissolution of clinopyroxene, in combination with the lack of serpentine reactivity, maintained low Mg/Ca ratios in solution. Clinopyroxene dissolution and unreactive serpentine may similarly maintain low Mg/Ca ratios in submarine serpentinization systems and limit magnesite formation in subseafloor environments. Results of this study suggest that the formation of Ca–Mg carbonates by mineral carbonation is favorable in subseafloor serpentinization systems and likely represents a significant, but poorly quantified, carbon sink in hydrothermally altered oceanic lithosphere at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges.},

	abstract = {Serpentinization and carbonation of ultramafic formations is a ubiquitous phenomenon, which deeply influences the biogeochemical cycles of water, hydrogen, carbon…while supporting the particular biosphere around the oceanic hydrothermal vents. Carbonation of peridotites and other mafic and ultramafic rocks is also a hot topic in the current energy landscape as the engineered sequestration of mineral CO2 in these formations could help reduce the atmospheric emissions and cope with climate change. In this study, we present two reactive percolation experiments performed on a natural serpentinite dredged from the ultraslow South-West Indian Oceanic Ridge. The serpentinite cores (length 3–4 cm and dia. 5.6 mm) were subjected for about 10 days to the continuous injection of a NaHCO3-saturated brine at respectively 160 °C and 280 °C. Petrographic and petrophysical results as well as outlet fluid compositions were compared to numerical batch simulations performed with the PHREEQC open software allowing to reconstruct the mineralogical evolution of both cores. The most striking observation is the fast and dramatic decrease of the permeability for both experiments principally due to the precipitation of carbonates. On the contrary, serpentine was found to be less impacting as it precipitates in low-flow zones, out of the main percolation paths. In total, about 5.6\% of the total injected CO2 was retained in the core, at 280 °C. In the same time, hydrogen was consistently produced with a total recovered H2 corresponding to 0.8\% of the maximum H2 possible. The global behavior of the cores is interpreted as the result from an interplay between interacting spatio-temporal lengthscales controlled by the Damköhler number.},

	abstract = {Ray trace travel time modeling of the seismic refraction record sections for a profile from near Soda Springs, Idaho, to near McKay, Idaho, was used to derive a crustal model across the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP). The derived crustal model is consistent with the velocity structure interpreted from a profile along the axis of the ESRP. The interpretation also indicates that significant lateral inhomogeneities exist in the upper crust beneath the ESRP when compared with the upper crust beneath the adjoining Northern Rocky Mountain and Basin and Range provinces. The most prominent features of the crustal structure inferred by the ray trace modeling are as follows: (1) The northwest margin of the ESRP was modeled as a fault structure, downthrown on the SRP side (SE) with an offset of greater than 4 km. The southeast margin, conversely, appears to be downwarped with possible minor faulting. Paleozoic sedimentary rocks are present beneath the Cenozoic volcanics of the ESRP possibly to and beyond 40 km from the southeastern margin of the ESRP near Blackfoot, Idaho. (2) The modeling indicates no abrupt variation in the depth to the top of the lower crustal layer near the margins of the ESRP. (3) An intermediate 6.5 km/s layer occurring beneath the ESRP, interpreted from a refraction profile located along the axis of the ESRP, was found to be localized within the ESRP margins. This layer is interpreted as a pervasive intrusion of higher velocity material from the upper mantle into the highly fractured upper crustal layer in this region. (4) A density model of the crust across the ESRP was prepared with the densities selected using the interpreted seismic velocities as a constraint. The gravity field calculated from this model resulted in a good match to observed gravity data over the eastern Snake River Plain.},

Structure derived previously for this region from wide-angle reflection data is used as an initial model, and this structure explains most features observed in our receiver functions. Based on a combination of forward and inverse modeling, our data require several modifications to the initial structure: (1) Moho depth is ∼42 km beneath most of the Snake River Plain, shallows to ∼37 km to either side, and thickens abruptly to ∼47 km beneath SW Wyoming; (2) a midcrustal layer interpreted previously as a ∼9-km-thick gabbroic sill is flat topped across the entire ∼90 km width of the Snake River Plain; and (3) a low-velocity layer is found beneath and southeast of the Snake River Plain, which probably is partially molten lower-most crust. Using the seismic structure of the crust to estimate the crustal load upon the mantle, and assuming local isostasy, we calculate that mantle beneath the Yellowstone swell is approximately uniformly as buoyant as 12-million-year-old ocean mantle, and more buoyant than the adjacent Wyoming mantle by an amount equivalent of ∼1.5 km of elevation. The transition between these regions of greatly different mantle occurs across a major Paleozoic boundary that now separates the Basin and Range from the Rocky Mountains.},

	abstract = {The eastern Snake River Plain in southern Idaho, western United States, is characterized by 1–2 km of Pleistocene to late Pliocene basalt overlying rhyolite caldera complexes. Cyclic variations in the chemical composition of basalts from 1136 m of scientific drill core show that the parent magmas of these lavas evolved by crystal fractionation at shallow to intermediate crustal depths, punctuated by episodic recharge with more primitive compositions and assimilation of adjacent wall rock. We have identified 10 upward fractionation cycles and four reversed cycles; assimilation of sialic crust was limited and mainly affects the oldest basalts, which directly overlie rhyolites. We infer that the crystal fractionation and/or recharge cycles took place in a series of sill-like intrusions at intermediate crustal depths that now form a layered mafic intrusion that underlies the eastern Snake River Plain at depth. This layered sill complex is represented by the ∼10-km-thick “basaltic sill” that has been imaged seismically at ∼12–22 km depth. The association of this mid-crustal sill complex with geochemical fractionation cycles in basalt supports the concept that exposed layered mafic intrusions may be linked to overlying basalt provinces that have since been removed by erosion.},

	abstract = {A map of groundwater temperatures from the Eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) regional aquifer can be used to identify and interpret important features of the aquifer, including aquifer flow direction, aquifer thickness, and potential geothermal anomalies. The ESRP is an area of high heat flow, yet most of this thermal energy fails to reach the surface, due to the heat being swept downgradient by the aquifer to the major spring complexes near Thousand Springs, ID, a distance of 300km. Nine deep boreholes that fully penetrate the regional aquifer display three common features: (1) high thermal gradients beneath the aquifer, corresponding to high conductive heat flow in low-permeability hydrothermally-altered rocks; (2) isothermal temperature profiles within the aquifer, characteristic of an actively flowing groundwater; and (3) moderate thermal gradients in the vadose zone with values that indicate that over half of the geothermal heat flow is removed by advective transport in the regional aquifer system. This study utilized temperature data from 250 ESRP aquifer wells to evaluate regional aquifer flow direction, aquifer thickness, and potential geothermal anomalies. Because the thermal gradients are typically low in the aquifer, any measurement of groundwater temperature is a reasonable estimate of temperature throughout the aquifer thickness, allowing the construction of a regional aquifer temperature map for the ESRP. Mapped temperatures are used to identify cold thermal plumes associated with recharge from tributary valleys and adjacent uplands, and warm zones associated with geothermal input to the aquifer. Warm zones in the aquifer can have various causes, including local circulation of groundwater through the deep conductively dominated region, slow groundwater movement in low-permeability regions, or localized heat flow from deeper thermal features.},

	abstract = {The engineered removal of atmospheric CO2 is now considered a key component of mitigating climate warming below 1.5 °C. Mineral carbonation is a potential negative emissions technique that, in the case of Iceland’s CarbFix experiment, precipitates dissolved CO2 as carbonate minerals in basaltic groundwater settings. Here we use calcium (Ca) isotopes in both pre- and post-CO2 injection waters to quantify the amount of carbonate precipitated, and hence CO2 stored. Ca isotope ratios rapidly increase with the pH and calcite saturation state, indicating calcite precipitation. Calculations suggest that up to 93\% of dissolved Ca is removed into calcite during certain phases of injection. In total, our results suggest that 165 ± 8.3 t CO2 were precipitated into calcite, an overall carbon storage efficiency of 72 ± 5\%. The success of this approach opens the potential for quantification of similar mineral carbonation efforts where drawdown rates cannot be estimated by other means.},

However, a less known but powerful result is that a NN with a single hidden layer can accurately approximate any nonlinear continuous operator. This universal approximation theorem of operators is suggestive of the structure and potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) in learning continuous operators or complex systems from streams of scattered data. Here, we thus extend this theorem to DNNs. We design a new network with small generalization error, the deep operator network (DeepONet), which consists of a DNN for encoding the discrete input function space (branch net) and another DNN for encoding the domain of the output functions (trunk net). We demonstrate that DeepONet can learn various explicit operators, such as integrals and fractional Laplacians, as well as implicit operators that represent deterministic and stochastic differential equations. We study different formulations of the input function space and its effect on the generalization error for 16 different diverse applications.},

	abstract = {A number of physical systems can be described by ordinary differential equations. When physics is well understood, the time dependent responses are easily obtained numerically. The particular numerical method used for integration depends on the application. Unfortunately, when physics is not fully understood, the discrepancies between predictions and observed responses can be large and unacceptable. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses observed data to estimate the missing physics in the original model (i.e., model-form uncertainty). In our approach, we first design recurrent neural networks to perform numerical integration of the ordinary differential equations. Then, we implement the recurrent neural network as a directed graph. This way, the nodes in the graph represent the physics-informed kernels found in the ordinary differential equations. We quantify the missing physics by carefully introducing data-driven in the directed graph. This allows us to estimate the missing physics (discrepancy term) even for hidden nodes of the graph. We studied the performance of our proposed approach with the aid of three case studies (fatigue crack growth, corrosion-fatigue crack growth, and bearing fatigue) and state-of-the-art machine learning software packages. Our results demonstrate the ability to perform estimation of discrepancy, reducing gap between predictions and observations, at reasonable computational cost.},

	abstract = {One of the obstacles hindering the scaling-up of the initial successes of machine learning in practical engineering applications is the dependence of the accuracy on the size and quality of the database that “drives” the algorithms. Incorporating the already-known physical laws into the training process can significantly reduce the request for data. In this study, we establish a neural network-based computational framework to characterize the finite deformation of elastic plates, which in classic theories is described by the Föppl–von Kármán (FvK) equations with a set of boundary conditions (BCs). A neural network is constructed by taking the spatial coordinates as the input and the displacement field as the output to approximate the exact solution of the FvK equations. The physical information (PDEs, BCs, and potential energy) is then incorporated into the loss function, and a pseudo dataset is sampled without knowing the exact solution to finally train the neural network. The accuracy of the modeling framework is carefully examined by applying it to four different loading cases: in-plane tension with non-uniformly distributed stretching forces, in-plane central-hole tension, out-of-plane deflection, and buckling under compression. Three ways of formulating the loss function are compared: (1) purely data-driven, (2) PDE-based, and (3) energy-based. Through the comparison with the finite element simulations, it is found that all the three approaches can characterize the elastic deformation of plates with a satisfactory accuracy if trained with a proper strategy in terms of sampling size and resolution. Compared with incorporating the PDEs and BCs in the loss, using the total potential energy shows certain advantage in terms of the simplicity of hyperparameter tuning and the computational efficiency.},

This paper introduces a deep learning approach called the tandem neural network architecture (TNNA), which consists of a forward network and a reverse network to estimate input parameters for RTMs. The TNNA approach has a limitation in that the approximation error from the forward network often results in biased inversion results. To solve this problem, we proposed to enhance TNNA using an adaptive updating strategy (AUS), which locally reduces the approximation error of the forward network. The developed framework updates the forward network by iteratively using local sampling and transfer learning. The TNNA-AUS was verified by a cation exchange example. The results show that TNNA-AUS successfully reduces the inversion bias and improves the computational efficiency and inversion accuracy, compared with the global improvement strategy of adding training samples according to the prior distribution of model parameters. After verification, the TNNA-AUS was applied to a real-world and well-documented RTM problem of the Aquia aquifer, Maryland, USA. The inversion results demonstrate that the developed TNNA-AUS algorithm is an excellent tool for us to understand the complex subsurface hydrogeochemical processes and estimate the associated reaction parameters.},

	abstract = {Deep-learning has achieved good performance and demonstrated great potential for solving forward and inverse problems. In this work, two categories of innovative deep-learning-based inverse modeling methods are proposed and compared. The first category is deep-learning surrogate-based inversion methods, in which the Theory-guided Neural Network (TgNN) is constructed as a deep-learning surrogate for problems with uncertain model parameters. By incorporating physical laws and other constraints, the TgNN surrogate can be constructed with limited simulation runs and accelerate the inversion process significantly. Three TgNN surrogate-based inversion methods are proposed, including the gradient method, the Iterative Ensemble Smoother method, and the training method. The second category is direct-deep-learning-inversion methods, in which TgNN constrained with geostatistical information, named TgNN-geo, is proposed as the deep-learning framework for direct inverse modeling. In TgNN-geo, two neural networks are introduced to approximate the random model parameters and the solution, respectively. In order to honor prior geostatistical information of the random model parameters, the neural network for approximating the random model parameters is first trained by using observed or generated realizations. Then, by minimizing the loss function of TgNN-geo, the estimation of model parameters and the approximation of the model solution can be simultaneously obtained. Since the prior geostatistical information can be incorporated, the direct-inversion method based on TgNN-geo works well, even in cases with sparse spatial measurements or imprecise prior statistics. Although the proposed deep-learning-based inverse modeling methods are general in nature, and thus applicable to a wide variety of problems, they are tested with several subsurface flow problems. It is found that satisfactory results are obtained with high efficiency. Moreover, both the advantages and disadvantages are further analyzed for the proposed two categories of deep-learning-based inversion methods.},

We have considered different types of materials: linear elasticity, hyperelasticity (neo-Hookean) with large deformation, and von Mises plasticity with isotropic and kinematic hardening. The performance of this deep collocation method (DCM) depends on the architecture of the neural network and the corresponding hyperparameters. The presented DCM is meshfree and avoids any spatial discretization, which is usually needed for the finite element method (FEM). We show that the DCM can capture the response qualitatively and quantitatively, without the need for any data generation using other numerical methods such as the FEM. Data generation usually is the main bottleneck in most data-driven models. The DL model is trained to learn the model's parameters yielding accurate approximate solutions. Once the model is properly trained, solutions can be obtained almost instantly at any point in the domain, given its spatial coordinates. Therefore, the DCM is potentially a promising standalone technique to solve PDEs involved in the deformation of materials and structural systems as well as other physical phenomena.},

	abstract = {Numerical methods such as finite element have been flourishing in the past decades for modeling solid mechanics problems via solving governing partial differential equations (PDEs). A salient aspect that distinguishes these numerical methods is how they approximate the physical fields of interest. Physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) is a novel approach developed in recent years for modeling PDE solutions and shows promise to solve computational mechanics problems without using any labeled data (e.g., measurement data is unavailable). The philosophy behind it is to approximate the quantity of interest (e.g., PDE solution variables) by a deep neural network (DNN) and embed the physical law to regularize the network. To this end, training the network is equivalent to minimization of a well-designed loss function that contains the residuals of the governing PDEs as well as initial/boundary conditions (I/BCs). In this paper, we present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) with mixed-variable output to model elastodynamics problems without resort to the labeled data, in which the I/BCs are forcibly imposed. In particular, both the displacement and stress components are taken as the DNN output, inspired by the hybrid finite-element analysis, which largely improves the accuracy and the trainability of the network. Since the conventional PINN framework augments all the residual loss components in a soft manner with Lagrange multipliers, the weakly imposed I/BCs may not be well satisfied especially when complex I/BCs are present. To overcome this issue, a composite scheme of DNNs is established based on multiple single DNNs such that the I/BCs can be satisfied forcibly in a forcible manner. The proposed PINN framework is demonstrated on several numerical elasticity examples with different I/BCs, including both static and dynamic problems as well as wave propagation in truncated domains. Results show the promise of PINN in the context of computational mechanics applications.},

In this study, we propose a graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated meshless Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code to model the flow of granular biomass materials. A modified void ratio-based mass conversation, a hybrid particle-to-particle/surface frictional boundary treatment, and a hypoplastic constitutive model are implemented. Four numerical examples, an elastic block sliding on inclined planes, sand column collapse, Angle of Repose, and axial compression tests for pine chips, were simulated using the developed SPH code. The results demonstrate good agreement between numerical predictions and analytical and experimental data for all four examples, validating the SPH code and increasing confidence that it can be applied to simulate more complex granular biomass handling processes, such as hopper feeding or auger conveyance.},

	abstract = {Geothermal energy is gaining attention as an environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. There exist complicated coupling processes among fluid flow, heat transfer, mechanical deformation, and chemical reaction in fractured geothermal reservoirs. Understanding of thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) coupled process is of significance for the efficient development of enhanced geothermal systems. This research aims to quantify the contributions of mechanical and chemical behaviors to reservoir feature variation during geothermal production. Herein, a fully coupled THMC model is developed for the production of an enhanced geothermal system based on fracture aperture alternation. The key improvement lies in the inclusion of mechanical-chemical (MC) coupling where chemical behaviors cause stress to be redistributed. On a geographical and temporal scale, the unique proportion technique is employed to study ratios of mechanical to chemical effects and poroelasticity to thermoelasticity. The findings emphasize the necessity of incorporating the MC coupling when analyzing reservoir characteristic variations. The mechanical effect plays a major role near the injection well and in a short term. The chemical effect is dominated far from the injection well and its time scale of action is long-term. The intensity of thermoelasticity is stronger than that of poroelasticity. Moreover, the proportion analysis reveals that when stable production is achieved, there are primarily thermo-driven and chemical-driven regions. To improve production performance and adjust geothermal reservoir features, injection temperature and solute concentration should be optimized. This paper serves as a valuable reference for both the theoretical multi-physical coupling model and practical geothermal production.},

	abstract = {Geothermal reservoir scaling controlled by reactive flow is a common phenomenon during geothermal development, which might lead to the decline of geothermal productivity and abandonment of geothermal projects. It is significant to reveal chemical influence on the geothermal reservoir characteristics and production performance to provide the reference for geothermal sustainable development. In this work, a thermal-hydraulic-chemical coupling model is developed for a triple-well fractured enhanced geothermal system considering the silica dissolution and precipitation at the fracture surface. It is focused on the evolution of fracture aperture and geothermal productivity. The results indicate that undersaturated injection will cause mineral dissolution which leads to the rise of fracture transmissibility and a thermal break. The fracture width is enhanced by 0.093 mm, and the permeability is 8 times the initial value after 20-year production. The oversaturated injection will cause mineral precipitation which leads to the reduction of fracture aperture and the increase of pressure difference. The opening is reduced by 0.041 mm and the permeability goes down by 2 orders of magnitude. The maximum increases of average production temperature and differential pressure are 10 °C and 13.5 MPa respectively in the 20th year from undersaturation to supersaturation. Besides, it is figured out that reaction rate denotes the evolution of fracture aperture. Both of them are distributed as a band at a fracture plane, which is determined by saturation index and temperature together. The former controls the reaction pattern (dissolution/precipitation) while the latter controls the reaction speed. Furthermore, the evolution of opening is uneven around the production well at different exploitation stages. Fracture width is higher on the strong side in the first 8.7 years but is higher on the weak side in later development when undersaturated water (0 mol/kg) is injected. The phenomenon can be employed to judge the production status, guide the descaling, etc. Production analysis indicates that oversaturation delays the heat breakthrough and undersaturation reduces the surface pump input. This study will provide a significant reference for the geothermal sustainable production influenced by chemical reactions in an enhanced geothermal system.},

	abstract = {A method was developed for experimentally observing the evolution of fracture aperture/permeability within a granite-based Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) in an attempt to better understand the reduction of fracture permeability due to chemical and mechanical processes. Specimens of granite were subjected to flow-through column-like experiments to characterize the evolution of fracture aperture/permeability in a near-field setting for 20 and 40 days. Near-field experimental conditions approached in-situ shallow EGS conditions: granite rock, tensile fracture, 120°C temperature, and 25–35MPa effective stress. Following each 20–40 day experiment, permeability, fracture aperture, and mass of minerals dissolved were computed using pore-pressure observations, effluent chemistry, and non-concurrent X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan imaging. Results showed an increased upstream pore pressure, which could indicate a decline in permeability due to a combination of the dissolution of fracture propping asperities and mechanical creep. Effluent solution composition was in agreement with the dissolution of silicates (most notably feldspars) which points to a geochemically driven decrease in aperture due to mineral dissolution rather than mechanical effects. In comparison, the pore pressure measurements corresponded to a greater aperture change than the effluent chemistry (0.127 vs 0.101μm, respectively). This discrepancy may be attributed to the contribution of other physical processes to fracture aperture change, including mechanical creep. Similarly, the CT scan showed a decreased fracture aperture, but the low resolution and non-concurrent scans influenced higher aperture closure estimates in comparison to the effluent chemistry and pore pressure measurements. However, the CT-scan confirmed the scale-dependency of the chemical and mechanical processes. Fundamentally, the study demonstrated a method for ensuring near-field conditions and observing the chemical and physical processes associated with fracture permeability decline.},

	abstract = {In geothermal reservoirs, coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical-chemical processes lead to gradual closure of fractures and consequent production decline. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of injected fluid type on the evolution of fracture aperture/permeability at various stress levels through a series of flow-through experiments on a fractured phyllite specimen, retrieved from a production well in the Blue Mountain geothermal field. The injected fluids included deionized water, silica super- and under-saturated fluids, and the geothermal fluid extracted from the Blue Mountain geothermal field. It was found that injection of geothermal and silica super-saturated fluids led to lowest and highest permeability reduction, respectively. In addition, the degree of permeability recovery was lower in the experiment using geothermal fluid compared to the experiment using silica super-saturated fluid. On the other hand, chemical analysis of the effluent samples revealed that injection of deionized water resulted in dissolution of feldspar and quartz, while precipitation of silica occurred in the experiment using geothermal fluid. Post-test observation by scanning electron microscopy of fracture surface area in the test using silica super-saturated fluid indicated some degree of mineral precipitation. A comparison between pre- and post-test computer tomography scan images for the experiment with injected silica super-saturated showed that mostly decrease in fracture aperture occurred, with increase in fracture aperture in a few regions along the fracture surface. Finally, the Three-Element rheological model successfully predicted the fracture permeability decay. The results of this study suggested that precipitation of silica, a major problem in permeability loss of geothermal systems, can be potentially minimized by using an injection fluid that is closer to chemical equilibrium state with the host rock.},

	abstract = {Examining the evolution of fracture permeability under stressed and temperature-elevated conditions, a series of flow-through experiments on a single rock fracture in granite has been conducted under confining pressures of 5 and 10MPa, under differential water pressures ranging from 0.04 to 0.5MPa, and at temperatures of 20–90°C, for several hundred hours in each experiment. Measurements of fluid and dissolved mass fluxes, and post-experimental microscopy, were conducted to constrain the progress of mineral dissolution and/or precipitation and to examine its effect on transport properties. Generally, the fracture aperture monotonically decreased with time at room temperature, and reached a steady state in relatively short periods (i.e., {\textless}400h). However, once the temperature was elevated to 90°C, the aperture resumed decreasing and kept decreasing throughout the rest of the experimental periods. This reduction may result from the removal of the mineral mass from the bridging asperities within the fracture. Post-experimental observations by scanning electron microscopy, coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), revealed the formation of several kinds of secondary minerals such as silica and calcite. However, the precipitated minerals seemed to have had little influence on the flow characteristics within the fracture, because the precipitation was limited to quite local and small areas. The evolving rates and ultimate magnitudes of the fracture aperture are likely to be controlled by the stress exerted over the contacting asperities and temperatures, and by the prescribed flow conditions. Thus, this complex behavior should be attributed to the coupled chemically- and mechanically-induced effect. A coupled chemo–mechano conceptual model, accounting for pressure and free-face dissolutions, is presented in this paper to follow the evolution of the fracture permeability observed in the flow-through experiments. This model addresses the two dissolution processes at the contacting asperities and the free walls within the fractures, and is also capable of describing multi-mineral dissolution behavior. The model shows that the evolution of a fracture aperture (or related permeability) and of element concentrations may be followed with time under arbitrary temperature and pressure conditions. The model predictions for the evolving fracture aperture and elements concentrations show a relatively good agreement with the experimental measurements, although it is not possible to replicate the abrupt reduction observed in the early periods of the experiments, which is likely to be due to an unaccounted mechanism of more stress-mediated fracture compaction driven by the fracturing of the propping asperities.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges faced today in a variety of geophysical applications is the need to understand the changes of elastic properties due to time-variant chemomechanical processes. The objective of this work is to model carbonate rock elastic properties as functions of pore geometry changes that occur when the solid matrix is dissolved by carbon dioxide. We compared two carbonate microstructures: porous micrite (“mudstone”) and grain-supported carbonate (“packstone”). We formulated a mathematical model that distinguishes the effects of microporosity and macroporosity on stiffness changes. We used measures of mechanical and chemical porosity changes recorded during injection tests to compute elastic moduli and compare them to moduli obtained from wave velocity measurements. In mudstones, both experimental and numerical results indicate that bulk moduli change by less than 5\%. The evolution of elastic moduli is controlled by macropore enlargement. In packstones, model predictions underestimate changes of elastic moduli with total porosity by 10\% to 80\%. The total porosity variation is 60\% to 75\% smaller than the chemical porosity variation, which indicates that pore expansion due to dissolution is counterbalanced by pore shrinkage due to compaction. Packstone elastic properties are controlled by grain sliding. The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized to other chemomechanical processes studied in rocks, such as dislocations, glide, diffusive mass transfer, recrystallization, and precipitation.},

	abstract = {Proppant crushing, a major proppant failure mechanism, occurs in geothermal energy and oil/gas stimulation production stages when the level of net stress exerted on the proppant exceeds the actual crush resistance of the material. Loss of effective reservoir conductivity due to proppant crushing can result in significant loss in productivity, and so it is crucial to understand the realistic proppant mechanical performances under deep reservoir conditions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of proppant crushing at the micro- to macro-levels by analyzing single proppant breakage, as well as re-arrangement and breakage mechanisms of proppant packs under in situ fracture environments. The choice of an appropriate proppant type based on the fracture treatment plays a key role in effective geothermal and oil/gas recovery. In addition, injection of proppants with better characteristics (higher sphericity, lower size, better gradation and lower granular porosity) can significantly influence the reduction of the extent of proppant crushing. Moreover, this study compares the performances and responses of different types of proppants upon proppant interaction with geothermal and oil/gas reservoir environments. Furthermore, this paper discusses various proppant types and their enhanced characteristics, which can be utilized as controlling measures for proppant crushing during unconventional energy extraction.},

High-strength corundum proppants were used at the Groß Schönebeck geothermal site. The long-term reaction of these corundum (Al2O3)-based compounds under geothermal reservoir conditions (high temperature and high salinity) could result in their dissolution and the eventual re-precipitation of secondary Al–Si minerals, thereby clogging the pores of the reservoir and severely reducing its permeability. We studied the chemical stabilities of two types of proppants (resin-coated and uncoated) under different reservoir-like conditions over time. In a batch experiment, proppants were placed into Teflon autoclaves containing either natural brines from Groß Schönebeck or synthetic brines. They were kept at ∼2bar and at either 150°C or 25°C for 12, 28, 42 or 80 days in NaCl and CaCl2 brines. The resulting precipitates are mainly composed of Na and Ca, with traces of Si and Fe. Up to 153mg/L of Si were measured in the solutions, with occasional Al (normally {\textless}1mg/L) and no Fe. The metal release was not affected by the resin coating. The high silica release during the experiment indicates some chemical instability of the proppants, which depends strongly on the temperature and salinity of the reservoir fluid.},

	abstract = {A 2D reactive transport model of the Dixie Valley geothermal area in Nevada, USA was developed to assess ﬂuid ﬂow pathways and ﬂuid rock interaction processes. The model includes two major normal faults and the incorporation of a dual continuum domain to simulate the presence of a small-scale thermal spring being fed by a highly permeable but narrow fracture zone. Simulations were performed incorporating ﬂuid ﬂow, heat conduction and advection, and kinetic mineral-water reactions. Various solute geothermometry methods were applied to simulated spring compositions, to compare estimated reservoir temperatures with “true” modeled reservoir temperatures, for a ﬂuid ascending the simulated fracture and cooling on its way to the surface. Under the modeled conditions (cooling but no mixing or boiling), the classical Na–K(–Ca) geothermometers performed best because these are least affected by mineral precipitation upon cooling. Geothermometry based on computed mineral saturation indices and the quartz geothermometer were more sensitive to re-equilibration upon cooling, but showed good results for ﬂuid velocities above ca. 0.1 m/d and a reactive fracture surface area 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding geometric surface area. This suggests that such upﬂow rates and relatively low reactive fracture surface areas are likely present in many geothermal ﬁelds. The simulations also suggest that the presence of small-scale fracture systems having an elevated permeability of 10−12 to 10−10 m2 can signiﬁcantly alter the shallow ﬂuid ﬂow regime of geothermal systems. For the Dixie Valley case, the model implies that such elevated permeabilities lead to a shallow (less than 1 km) convection cell where superﬁcial water inﬁltrates along the range front normal fault and connects the small-scale geothermal spring through basin ﬁlling sediments. Furthermore, we conclude that a fracture permeability on the order of 10−12 m2 may lead to near surface temperature {\textgreater}100 ◦C whereas a permeability of 10−10 m2 is not realistic because this permeability led to extreme upﬂow velocities and to a short-circuit of the regional fault zone.},

	abstract = {Geothermal energy is commonly recognized as an environmentally friendly source of energy. However, geothermal fluids have unusually high CO2 content, particularly, in carbonated geothermal reservoirs. An efficient method to mitigate the CO2 emissions of geothermal power plants is to re-inject the captured CO2 with the effluent fluid to mineralize mainly into calcite under reservoir conditions (e.g., reservoir temperatures ranging from 200 to 220 °C). One of the major concerns about the re-injection of the captured CO2 is to predict the geochemical interaction between the injected fluid-CO2 and rock, and the corresponding alterations that occur due to the re-injection in the reservoir parameters. For this study, we have selected one of the largest geothermal fields, which is located in the western part of Turkey. A predictive 3-D reactive transport modeling is carried out using TOUGHREACT v1.2 for potential fluid-CO2 injection into deep metamorphic formation rocks consisting of marble, quartzite, and schist. Each rock type with different mineral constituents is examined in three different scenarios. Moreover, in each scenario, three annual injection rates, 500, 2000, and 4000 tons of CO2 for ten years of continuous injection are tested. The aims of the study are first the evaluation of the dynamic fluid-rock interactions with maximum possible CO2-charged fluid injection and second the identification of the mineralization process. The modeling results indicate that the maximum CO2-charged fluid mixture remains stable as a single-phase in all scenarios. The mineralization process of CO2 in the reservoir is limited due to the different mineral contents of the considered metamorphic rocks and the differences between the CO2 mass fraction of the injected fluid and the reservoir. In addition, the injected fluid temperature, the pH, the convective dispersive fluxes between the wells also affect the chemical process. These results show differences compared to the CarbFix project carried out in basaltic Icelandic geothermal reservoirs where the CO2 mineralization process was successful.},

	abstract = {A coupled THMC (thermal-hydrological-mechanical-chemical) model is developed and applied to explore the potential feasibility of using scCO2 (supercritical carbon dioxide) as a working fluid in geothermal reservoirs. This is achieved by examining the evolution of the kinetics of mineral precipitation-dissolution and its associated impact on the evolution of the rock permeability and porosity. The pH of the reservoir rapidly reduces from 7 to ∼4.5–5 due to the fast dissolution of calcite. Chemical reactions and mineral dissolution and precipitation near the injector are suppressed by the plug-flow penetration of anhydrous scCO2 displacing the original pore fluid. A conceptual three-zone model is proposed to illustrate the kinetic process of feldspar dissolution and precipitation depending on timing. The initial high concentration of K+ prompts feldspar to precipitate in the first stage by consuming K+ until 1y, Feldspar were dissolved into precipitations of illite, smectite, and siderite at 1-6y, with albite, muscovite and kaolinite mostly precipitated in the last stage 6–10y. The precipitations of secondary clay minerals and quartz serve to maintain the integrity of caprock sealing. Continuous scCO2 injection under fully coupled THMC model shows a 1.4-times enhancement of fracture permeability and 1.2-times enhancement of matrix permeability dominated by chemical dissolution and thermal unloading process. The pronounced thermal drawdown is the principal factor in enhancing permeability and porosity near injection well. Furthermore, the expansive capability of CO2 provides extra benefits in enhancing formation pressure to ensure consistent high flow rates, while achieving a higher thermal energy extraction efficiency and preventing scaling issues in wellbore. The mass concentration of scCO2 in the production well increased to 0.82 after 1.2 × 108s also leads to the enhancement of fluid enthalpy up to 6.5 × 105 J/kg, due to the high heat capacity of scCO2.

The circulating heat extraction process of working fluid will disturb the equilibrium state of physical and chemical fields inside the reservoir, and involve the mutual coupling of heat transfer, flow, stress, and chemical reaction. Revealing the coupling mechanism of flow and heat transfer inside the reservoir during geothermal exploitation can provide important theoretical support for the efficient exploitation of geothermal resources. This paper reviews the research advances of the multi-field coupling model in the reservoir during geothermal production over the past 40 years. The thrust of this paper is on objective analysis and evaluation of the importance of each coupling process and its influence on reservoir heat extraction performance. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges and perspectives to promote the future development of the geothermal reservoir multi-field coupling model.

	abstract = {Acid fracturing and hydraulic fracturing are two useful methods to improve productivity of geothermal wells. Compared with hydraulic fracturing, it remains challenging to select and design an optimal scheme of acid fracturing in geotherm reservoirs due to the complex chemical reactions between acidizing fluids and reservoir rocks. A modeling framework for the coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical-chemical processes during acid fracturing in carbonatite geothermal reservoirs is developed, which is verified using the published experimental results. Effects of natural and human-controlled factors on efficiency of acid fracturing are investigated through parameter sensitivity analysis. The results show that the two human-controlled parameters including acid concentration and injection rate play an important role in determining propagation area, whereas the acid etching pattern is mainly dependent on natural reservoir parameters including aperture field, reservoir temperature and in-situ stress. The developed modeling framework is successfully applied to simulate a field test of acid fracturing in a geothermal well, Beijing, China. The further follow-up research and limitations of the present study are also addressed.},

New correlations continue to be proposed and there appears to be no general agreement regarding which correlation is the most accurate. In this work, experiments have been carried out with water using glass spheres of nine different sizes, varying from 1.18mm to 9.99mm. For each size, experiments were repeated with at least two different porosities. A total of 38 correlations from the literature have been evaluated and a uniform notation was established to facilitate the comparison of the correlations. While the Ergun equation remains the most widely-used correlation, the data collected in this work shows that it should not be used above Rem≈500. A simple new equation (fV=160+2.81Rem0.904) is proposed to represent the data collected in this work. The new equation yields the smallest mean error among all the correlations considered here. While a substantial amount of the data collected in this work involved D/dP ratios less than 10, the correlations that fit the current data best do not have any wall effect correction terms.},

	abstract = {Machine Learning methods and, in particular, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in material constitutive modeling. One of the main drawbacks of such approaches is the lack of a rigorous frame based on the laws of physics. This may render physically inconsistent the predictions of a trained network, which can be even dangerous for real applications. Here we propose a new class of data-driven, physics-based, neural networks for constitutive modeling of strain rate independent processes at the material point level, which we define as Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks (TANNs). The two basic principles of thermodynamics are encoded in the network’s architecture by taking advantage of automatic differentiation to compute the numerical derivatives of a network with respect to its inputs. In this way, derivatives of the free-energy, the dissipation rate and their relation with the stress and internal state variables are hardwired in the architecture of TANNs. Consequently, our approach does not have to identify the underlying pattern of thermodynamic laws during training, reducing the need of large data-sets. Moreover the training is more efficient and robust, and the predictions more accurate. Finally and more important, the predictions remain thermodynamically consistent, even for unseen data. Based on these features, TANNs are a starting point for data-driven, physics-based constitutive modeling with neural networks. We demonstrate the wide applicability of TANNs for modeling elasto-plastic materials, using both hyper- and hypo-plasticity models. Strain hardening and softening are also considered for the hyper-plastic scenario. Detailed comparisons show that the predictions of TANNs outperform those of standard ANNs. Finally, we demonstrate that the implementation of the laws of thermodynamics confers to TANNs high robustness in the presence of noise in the training data, compared to standard approaches. TANNs’ architecture is general, enabling applications to materials with different or more complex behavior, without any modification.},

It has presented success and versatility in cases of simple stress paths due to its strong non-linear mapping capacity without limitations of constitutive formulations. However, current studies on the ML-based constitutive modeling of soils is still very limited. This study comprehensively reviews the application of ML algorithms in the development of constitutive models of soils and compares the performance of different ML algorithms. First, the basic principles of typical ML algorithms used in describing soil behaviors are briefly elaborated. The main characteristics and the limitations of such ML algorithms are summarized and compared. Then, the methodology of developing a ML-based soil model is reviewed from six aspects, such as adopted ML algorithms, data source, framework of the ML-based model, training strategy, generalization ability and application scope. Finally, five new ML-based models are developed using five typical ML algorithms (i.e. BPNN, RBF, LSTM, GRU and BiLSTM that can predict multi outputs together) based on same set of experimental results of sand, and compare each other in terms of the predictive accuracy and generalization ability. Results show the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and its variants are most suitable for developing constitutive models. Moreover, some useful suggestions for developing the ML-based soil model are also provided for the community.},

CANNs can easily and efficiently be implemented in standard computational software. They require only a low-to-moderate amount of training data and training time to learn without human guidance the constitutive behavior also of complex nonlinear and anisotropic materials. Moreover, in a simple academic example we demonstrate how the input of microstructural data can endow CANNs with the ability to describe not only the behavior of known materials but to predict also the properties of new materials where no stress-strain data are available yet. This ability may be particularly useful for the future in-silico design of new materials.

	abstract = {Constitutive and closure models play important roles in computational mechanics and computational physics in general. Classical constitutive models for solid and fluid materials are typically local, algebraic equations or flow rules describing the dependence of stress on the local strain and/or strain-rate. Closure models such as those describing Reynolds stress in turbulent flows and laminar–turbulent transition can involve transport PDEs (partial differential equations). Such models play similar roles to constitutive relation, but they are often more challenging to develop and calibrate as they describe nonlocal mappings and often contain many submodels. Inspired by the structure of the exact solutions to linear transport PDEs, we propose a neural network representing a region-to-point mapping to describe such nonlocal constitutive models. The range of nonlocal dependence and the convolution structure are derived from the formal solution to transport equations. The neural network-based nonlocal constitutive model is trained with data. Numerical experiments demonstrate the predictive capability of the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed network learned the embedded submodel without using data from that level, thanks to its interpretable mathematical structure, which makes it a promising alternative to traditional nonlocal constitutive models.},

The performance of the proposed LSTM method is verified through a dataset collected from laboratory tests. The results indicate that the LSTM deep-learning method outperforms the feed forward and feedback neural networks based on both accuracy and the convergence rate when reproducing the soil’s stress–strain behaviour.

	abstract = {(Artificial) neural networks have become increasingly popular in mechanics and materials sciences to accelerate computations with model order reduction techniques and as universal models for a wide variety of materials. However, the major disadvantage of neural networks remains: their numerous parameters are challenging to interpret and explain. Thus, neural networks are often labeled as black boxes, and their results often elude human interpretation. The new and active field of physics-informed neural networks attempts to mitigate this disadvantage by designing deep neural networks on the basis of mechanical knowledge. By using this a priori knowledge, deeper and more complex neural networks became feasible, since the mechanical assumptions can be explained. However, the internal reasoning and explanation of neural network parameters remain mysterious. Complementary to the physics-informed approach, we propose a first step towards a physics-explaining approach, which interprets neural networks trained on mechanical data a posteriori. This proof-of-concept explainable artificial intelligence approach aims at elucidating the black box of neural networks and their high-dimensional representations. Therein, the principal component analysis decorrelates the distributed representations in cell states of RNNs and allows the comparison to known and fundamental functions. The novel approach is supported by a systematic hyperparameter search strategy that identifies the best neural network architectures and training parameters. The findings of three case studies on fundamental constitutive models (hyperelasticity, elastoplasticity, and viscoelasticity) imply that the proposed strategy can help identify numerical and analytical closed-form solutions to characterize new materials.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of a general, diffused flow of molecular hydrogen (H2) through the Western Hajar mountains of Northern Oman. H2 was detected across a fracture system in the peridotites of the Semail ophiolite massif, and no traces of this gas were found in unfractured peridotites. H2 seeps in these rocks have been classically interpreted to be the result of reduction of groundwater during the process of peridotite serpentinization. However, there is evidence of hydrogen seepage in other geological units of Northern Oman, particularly in the Precambrian to Early Permian metamorphic sequences of the Jebel Akhdar massif, and to a lesser extent in the Hawasina sequence underthrust beneath the ophiolitic units. As a consequence, hydrogen flows are also being detected from geological formations structurally located below the ophiolites. Our sampling shows that increased flow is not observed in the peridotites, but in the deeper stratigraphic and structural units (Upper Proterozoic). These observations suggest a source of H2 existing below the ophiolites. Minimum estimated H2 flows using various methods range from 70 to 150 m3/km2 per day from peridotites and up to 1300 m3/km2 per day from the Upper Proterozoic.},

In contrast with continuum breakage mechanics, the de facto approach for the macroscopic analysis of crushable granular media, the present framework does not require the definition of constitutive models and phenomenological assumptions, relying on material behavior that is known only through empirical data. For this purpose, we revisit the recent developments in model-free data-driven computing for history-dependent materials and extend the main ideas to materials with particle breakage. A systematic construction of the modeling framework is presented, starting from the closed-form representation of continuum breakage mechanics and arriving at alternative model-free representations. The predictive ability of the data-driven framework is highlighted and contrasted with continuum breakage mechanics on different boundary value problems.

In particular, our focus is to introduce a practical framework that can be deployed for engineering analysis that employs a user-defined material subroutine (UMAT/VUMAT) for ABAQUS, which is written in FORTRAN. To accomplish this task while leveraging the back-propagation learning algorithm to speed up the neural-network training, we introduce an interface code where the weights and biases of the trained neural networks obtained via the PyTorch library can be automatically converted into a generic FORTRAN code that can be a part of the UMAT/VUMAT algorithm. To enable third-party validation, we purposely make all the data sets, source code used to train the neural-network-based constitutive models, and the trained models available in a public repository. Furthermore, the practicality of the workflow is then further tested on a dataset for anisotropic yield function to showcase the extensibility of the proposed framework. A number of representative numerical experiments are used to examine the accuracy, robustness and reproducibility of the results generated by the neural network models.},

	abstract = {The analytical description of path-dependent elastic-plastic responses of a granular system is highly complicated because of continuously evolving microstructures and strain localisation within the system undergoing deformation. This study offers an alternative to the current analytical paradigm by developing micromechanics-informed machine-learning based constitutive modelling approaches for granular materials. A set of critical variables associated with the constitutive behaviour of granular materials are identified through an incremental stress-strain relationship analysis. Depending on the strategy to exploit the priori micromechanical knowledge, three different training strategies are explored. The first model uses only the measurable external variables to make stress predictions; the second model utilises a directed graph to link all the external strain sequences and internal microstructural evolution variables into a single prediction model comprised of a series of sub-mappings, and the third model explicitly integrates the physically important non-temporal properties with external strain paths into training through an enhanced Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). These three models show satisfactory agreement with unseen test specimens based on multi-directional loading cases. The basic features and potential applications of each model are explained. Furthermore, the key factors for constitutive training and limitations of the current work are also discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {The Mohr-Coulomb theory of strength identifies cohesion and internal friction as the two principal contributions to the shear strength of a granular material. The contribution of cohesion in over-compacted granular materials has been challenged and replacing cohesion with interlocking has been proposed. A theory of rupture strength that includes interlocking is derived herein. The physics-chemistry concept of critical state is elaborated to accommodate granular materials, based on empirical definitions established in the fields of soil mechanics and bulk solids’ flow. A surface in state space, called the critical compaction surface, separates over-compacted states from lightly compacted states. The intersection of this surface with the Mohr-Coulomb envelope forms the critical state surface for a granular material. The rupture strength of an over-compacted granular material is expressed as the sum of cohesion, internal friction and interlocking strength. Interlocking strength is the shear strength contribution due to over-compaction and vanishes at critical state. The theory allows migrations from one critical state to another. Changes in specific volume during such migrations are related to changes in mean-normal effective stress and uncoupled from changes in shearing strain. The theory is reviewed with respect to two established research programs and underlying assumptions are identified.},

Since convective coefficients are typically unknown, current analysis approaches based on trial-and-error finite element (FE) simulations are slow. The loss function is defined based on errors to satisfy PDE, BCs and initial condition. An adaptive normalizing scheme is developed to reduce loss terms simultaneously. In addition, theory of heat transfer is used for feature engineering. The predictions for 1D and 2D cases are validated by comparing with FE results. While comparing with theory-agnostic ML methods, it is shown that only by using physics-informed activation functions, the heat transfer beyond the training zone can be accurately predicted. Trained models were successfully used for real-time evaluation of thermal responses of parts subjected to a wide range of convective BCs.},

The created PINN models account for variable fluid properties, species- and heat-diffusion, and convection. Both the mentioned PINN architectures were trained using different hyperparameter settings, such as network width and depth, to find the best-performing configuration. It is shown that the segregated-network PINN approach results in on-average 62\% lower losses when compared to the single-network PINN architecture for the given problem. Furthermore, the single-network variant struggled to ensure species mass conservation in different areas of the computational domain, whereas the segregated approach successfully maintained species conservation. The PINN predicted velocity, temperature, and species profiles for a given set of boundary conditions were compared to results generated using OpenFOAM software. Both the single- and segregated-network PINN models produced accurate results for temperature and velocity profiles, with average percentage difference relative to the computational fluid dynamics results of approximately 7.5\% for velocity and 8\% for temperature. The mean error percentages for the species mass fractions are 9\% for the single-network model and 1.5\% for the segregated-network approach. To showcase the applicability of PINNs for surrogate modeling of multi-species problems, a parameterized version of the segregated-network PINN is trained that could produce results for different water vapor inlet velocities. The normalized mean absolute percentage errors, relative to the OpenFOAM results, across three predicted cases for velocity and temperature are approximately 7.5\% and 2.4\% for water vapor mass fraction.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have received significant attention as a unified framework for forward, inverse, and surrogate modeling of problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Training PINNs for forward problems, however, pose significant challenges, mainly because of the complex non-convex and multi-objective loss function. In this work, we present a PINN approach to solving the equations of coupled flow and deformation in porous media for both single-phase and multiphase flow. To this end, we construct the solution space using multi-layer neural networks. Due to the dynamics of the problem, we find that incorporating multiple differential relations into the loss function results in an unstable optimization problem, meaning that sometimes it converges to the trivial null solution, other times it moves very far from the expected solution. We report a dimensionless form of the coupled governing equations that we find most favorable to the optimizer. Additionally, we propose a sequential training approach based on the stress-split algorithms of poromechanics. Notably, we find that sequential training based on stress-split performs well for different problems, while the classical strain-split algorithm shows an unstable behavior similar to what is reported in the context of finite element solvers. We use the approach to solve benchmark problems of poroelasticity, including Mandel’s consolidation problem, Barry–Mercer’s injection-production problem, and a reference two-phase drainage problem.

	abstract = {Plasticity theory aims at describing the yield loci and work hardening of a material under general deformation states. Most of its complexity arises from the nontrivial dependence of the yield loci on the complete strain history of a material and its microstructure. This motivated 3 ingenious simplifications that underpinned a century of developments in this field: 1) yield criteria describing yield loci location; 2) associative or nonassociative flow rules defining the direction of plastic flow; and 3) effective stress–strain laws consistent with the plastic work equivalence principle. However, 2 key complications arise from these simplifications. First, finding equations that describe these 3 assumptions for materials with complex microstructures is not trivial. Second, yield surface evolution needs to be traced iteratively, i.e., through a return mapping algorithm. Here, we show that these assumptions are not needed in the context of sequence learning when using recurrent neural networks, diverting the above-mentioned complications. This work offers an alternative to currently established plasticity formulations by providing the foundations for finding history- and microstructure-dependent constitutive models through deep learning.},

The framework employs an encoder to project high-dimensional input information (e.g., loading history, loading conditions, and materials information) to a lower-dimensional hidden space and a decoder to map the hidden representation to the stress of interest. We evaluated various encoder architectures, including gated recurrent unit (GRU), GRU with attention, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and the Transformer encoder, on two complex stress-strain datasets that were designed to include a wide range of complex loading histories and loading conditions. All architectures achieved excellent test results with an root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 1 MPa. Additionally, we analyzed the capability of the different architectures to make predictions on out-of-domain applications, with an uncertainty estimation based on deep ensembles. The proposed approach provides a robust alternative to empirical/semi-empirical models for CRs modeling, offering the potential for more accurate and efficient materials design and optimization.},

First, the practical requirements for the constitutive models of stress-strain relationship with ultra-long-history-memory are summarized, which is favorable for adopting the TCN model in sequence modeling. The traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling are compared with the TCN model and the advantages of the TCN model for constitutive modeling are illustrated. Subsequently, the architecture of the TCN model for the constitutive modeling of steel and concrete material is illustrated in detail. In the TCN model, multiple dilated convolutional layers achieve long-term history dependence, while the causal convolution guarantees the stress is only updated based on historical strain history instead of the whole loading process. Third, a one-dimensional (1D) concrete stress-strain relationship dataset is established with significant stiffness degradation, strength degradation, and pinching effect. Two 1D reinforced concrete (RC) stress-strain datasets are established with steel content ratios of 1\% and 10\%. A two-dimensional (2D) low-yield-point steel dataset is also established. Fourth, the performance of the TCN model is evaluated for 1D concrete, steel, and RC datasets and 2D steel dataset. The TCN model achieves higher prediction accuracy and efficiency compared to the traditional RNN model for constitutive modeling. The influence of kernel size, hidden dimension of convolutional filter, and the number of convolutional layers on the test set performance are reported in detail. Finally, three prospective implementations of the proposed TCN model in solid mechanics are proposed, including the physics-informed machine learning, the multi-scale transfer learning framework, and the finite element force method.},

The second example applies HiDeNN for multiscale analysis with sub-neural networks at each material point of macroscale. The final example demonstrates how HiDeNN can discover governing dimensionless parameters from experimental data so that a reduced set of input can be used to increase the learning efficiency.

In HiDeNN-FEM, weights and biases are functions of the nodal positions, hence the training process in HiDeNN-FEM includes the optimization of the nodal coordinates. This is the spirit of r-adaptivity, and it increases both the local and global accuracy of the interpolants. By fixing the number of hidden layers and increasing the number of neurons by training the DNNs, rh-adaptivity can be achieved, which leads to further improvement of the accuracy for the solutions. The generalization of rational functions is achieved by the development of three fundamental building blocks of constructing deep hierarchical neural networks. The three building blocks are linear functions, multiplication, and inversion. With these building blocks, the class of deep learning interpolation functions are demonstrated for interpolation theories such as Lagrange polynomials, NURBS, isogeometric, reproducing kernel particle method, and others. In HiDeNN-FEM, enrichment functions through the multiplication of neurons is equivalent to the enrichment in standard finite element methods, that is, generalized, extended, and partition of unity finite element methods. Numerical examples performed by HiDeNN-FEM exhibit reduced approximation error compared with the standard FEM. Finally, an outlook for the generalized HiDeNN to high-order continuity for multiple dimensions and topology optimizations are illustrated through the hierarchy of the proposed DNNs.},

	abstract = {We present the application of a class of deep learning, known as Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN), to learning and discovery in solid mechanics. We explain how to incorporate the momentum balance and constitutive relations into PINN, and explore in detail the application to linear elasticity, and illustrate its extension to nonlinear problems through an example that showcases von{\textasciitilde}Mises elastoplasticity. While common PINN algorithms are based on training one deep neural network (DNN), we propose a multi-network model that results in more accurate representation of the field variables. To validate the model, we test the framework on synthetic data generated from analytical and numerical reference solutions. We study convergence of the PINN model, and show that Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) results in superior accuracy and convergence characteristics compared with classic low-order Finite Element Method (FEM). We also show the applicability of the framework for transfer learning, and find vastly accelerated convergence during network re-training. Finally, we find that honoring the physics leads to improved robustness: when trained only on a few parameters, we find that the PINN model can accurately predict the solution for a wide range of parameters new to the network---thus pointing to an important application of this framework to sensitivity analysis and surrogate modeling.},

	abstract = {A potential risk of injecting CO2 into storage reservoirs with marginal permeability (≲ 10 mD (1 mD = 10−15 m2)) is that commercial injection rates could induce fracturing of the reservoir and/or the caprock. Such fracturing is essentially fluid-driven fracturing in the leakoff-dominated regime. Recent studies suggested that fracturing, if contained within the lower portion of the caprock complex, could substantially improve the injectivity without compromising the overall seal integrity. Modeling this phenomenon entails complex coupled interactions among the fluids, the fracture, the reservoir, and the caprock. We develop a simple method to capture all these interplays in high fidelity by sequentially coupling a hydraulic fracturing module with a coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical (THM) model for nonisothermal multiphase flow. The model was made numerically tractable by taking advantage of self-stabilizing features of leakoff-dominated fracturing. The model is validated against the PKN solution in the leakoff-dominated regime. Moreover, we employ the model to study thermo-poromechanical responses of a fluid-driven fracture in a field-scale carbon storage reservoir that is loosely based on the In Salah project's Krechba reservoir. The model reveals complex yet intriguing behaviors of the reservoir-caprock-fluid system with fracturing induced by cold CO2 injection. We also study the effects of the in situ stress contrast between the reservoir and caprock and thermal contraction on the vertical containment of the fracture. The proposed model proves effective in simulating practical problems on length and time scales relevant to geological carbon storage.},

	abstract = {The governing equations for subsurface flow codes in a deformable porous media are derived from the balance of fluid mass and Darcy's equation. One class of these codes, which we call general subsurface flow codes (GSFs), allow for more general constitutive relations for material properties such as porosity, permeability and density. Examples of GSFs include PFLOTRAN, FEHM, TOUGH2, STOMP, and some reservoir simulators such as BOAST. Depending on the constitutive relations used in GSFs, an inconsistency arises between the standard groundwater flow equation and the governing equation of GSFs, and we clarify that the reason for this inconsistency is because the Darcy's equation used in the GSFs should account for the velocity of fluid with respect to solid. Due to lack of awareness of this inconsistency, users of the GSFs tend to use a porosity-pressure relationship that comes from the standard groundwater flow equation and assumes that the relative velocity is already accounted for. For the Theis problem, we show that using this traditional relationship in the GSFs leads to significantly large errors. We propose an alternate porosity-pressure relationship that is consistent with the derivation of the governing equations in the GSFs where the solid velocity is not tracked, and show that, with this relationship, the results are more accurate for the Theis problem. The purpose of this note is to make the users and developers of these GSFs aware of this inconsistency and to advocate that the alternate porosity model derived here should be incorporated in GSFs.},

This addresses the limitation of EDFM to low-conductivity fractures and is much faster than DFM and fully coupled schemes, which have mostly been applied to the modeling of fracture propagation in fractured reservoirs. The validation studies presented indicate the accuracy of our model at reproducing the analytical solutions to coupled geomechanics and fracture propagation problems. We show that the iterative coupling of pEDFM with XFEM accounts for the interaction between the propagating hydraulic fracture and low-conductivity natural fractures in its vicinity, whereas EDFM does not. This is important when modeling hydraulic fracturing and the subsequent production from multiply fractured hydraulic wells. The iterative coupling approach used in this work provides the flexibility and simplicity needed to model complex fluid and rock behaviors in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs.},

Three forms of asymptotic states are defined. Useful criteria to describe the tensorial part of the constitutive relation is developed for one of them, namely for the critical states. The terms proposed by Wu are correlated to the well-known formulations of elastic plastic theory: the Drucker/Prager model and the yield condition by Matsuoka/Nakai. The suitability of the Matsuoka/Nakai criterion for critical states is discussed. Specification of tensorial functions follows in two steps. First the hypoplastic Drucker/Prager model is developed, and then the limit condition by Matsuoka/Nakai is implemented. The resulting tensorial functions require the critical friction angle as the only material constant. The limit condition in critical states obtained from the hypoplastic law coincide with the one by Matsuoka/Nakai. A more comprehensive hypoplastic constitutive relation based on these new tensorial functions is discussed and applied to simulations of element tests.

Nowadays, the physics informed neural network (PINN) is gaining popularity in solving the Richardson Richards equation (RRE) thanks to its mesh-free, physics-constrained, and data-driven properties. Despite several successful applications in modelling 1D infiltration problems, its capability and stability to deal with more complicated boundary conditions and multidimensional problems still need to be examined. This paper investigates the impacts of the loss weights and random state on the performance of the RRE-solving PINNs and possible solutions to mitigate such impacts. Two loss-balanced PINNs, GN-PINN and PLF-PINN, were compared to the baseline PINN in modelling three unsaturated groundwater flow problems. The results show that the performance of the baseline PINN severely depends on the loss weight configurations and random states. While GN-PINN’s tendency to ignore the train loss term makes it infeasible for solving RRE, PLF-PINN can strike a good balance between loss terms and hence enhance PINN’s robustness against loss weight initialization and random state greatly.},

In this paper, we introduce the physics-informed neural network (PINN) method to investigate the mass transfer of CO2 injected into a homogeneous subsurface porous formation, where the concentration and the streamfunction are approximated by neural network representations. To mitigate the computational burden and training difficulties arising from learning the long-term diffusion and convection processes, we implement a time domain decomposition-based scheme so that the PINN solution can represent short-interval dynamics in a sequential manner. Furthermore, Fourier-type basis functions are encoded in the PINN architecture to map the spatial coordinates onto an embedding feature space characterized by various frequencies. The numerical results show that the use of Fourier feature embedding improves the training performance by handling the notorious spectral bias in deep neural networks and enhances the stability for long-term prediction of flow and transport. The proposed PINN method is applied to a benchmark problem to understand the effect of natural convection on the simulation performance. Compared to the high-fidelity stabilized FEM solution, the PINN approach presents agreeable statistical characteristics of CO2-rich brine fingers, demonstrating the effectiveness of PINNs in modeling density-driven flow.},

Detailed analyses show that embedding these physics into the architecture of the neural network facilitates a more efficient training of the network with less training data, while also enhancing the extrapolation capability for loading regimes outside the training data. The architecture of EPNN is model and material-independent; it can be adapted to a wide range of elasto-plastic material types, including geomaterials; and experimental data can potentially be directly used in training the network. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed architecture, we adapt its general framework to the elasto-plastic behavior of sands. We use synthetic data generated from material point simulations based on a relatively advanced dilatancy-based constitutive model for granular materials to train the neural network. The superiority of EPNN over regular neural network architectures is demonstrated through predicting unseen strain-controlled loading paths for sands with different initial densities.},

	abstract = {Subsurface geological reservoirs of natural hydrogen gas (H2), a clean fuel and energy vector, are currently a target for energy resource exploration. Such reservoirs can be revealed by the presence of H2 within soil, analogous to hydrocarbon seepage in petroleum systems. Nevertheless, defining the level of soil H2 that can indicate a potentially economic resource is currently impossible, and identifying geological H2 within soil-gas is challenging because H2 concentrations and the isotopic composition (δ2H) may overlap with the in-situ biological signature. In spite of these limitations, analogies to conventional hydrocarbon systems suggest that the presence of surface advective gas flows can reveal (unlike diffusion) a subsoil source and even pressurised gas accumulations of H2. Here, a massive release of H2 is reported from a CH4–H2 rich seep in Turkey, known as Chimaera, an emblematic example of H2 advection. The site represents the first case where a closed-chamber flux method was applied for H2 seepage. H2 advection at the site was clearly indicated by numerous gas vents and flames, and by the heterogeneous spatial distribution of pervasive, invisible exhalation (miniseepage), inducing rapid H2 concentration build-up within the chamber. H2 emission (∼10 ± 3 kg day−1, with the highest H2 emission factor reported, thus far, of ∼5000 kg km−2 day−1) is continuous and long lasting (flames have been documented for millennia) and, using an analogy for hydrocarbon seeps, may stem from pressurised accumulations. The Chimaera case is illustrative of how detecting soil H2 advection may help unravel surface (biological) vs. subsoil (geological) gas origins in cases where, in the absence of significant gas seepage, soil H2 concentrations are within the range of biological production (100-103 ppmv, e.g., as for “fairy circles” observed in several countries). Interpretations must, however, be supported by additional geochemical data and evaluations of potential biological H2 production within the surface ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen-rich hydrothermal areas, such as those in the Indian Ocean, may have had an influence on early evolution of life on Earth and thus have attracted interest because they may be a proxy for ancient ecosystems. The Kairei and Edmond hydrothermal fields in the Indian Ocean are separated by 160 km, but exhibit distinct fluid chemistry: Kairei fluids are hydrogen-rich; Edmond fluids are hydrogen-poor. At this region, the Central Indian Ridge shows an intermediate spreading rate, 48 mm year−1 as full rate, where the hydrothemal fields occur. Kairei field vent fluids show persistently high concentrations of H2. The Kairei field seems to be unique among hydrogen-enriched hydrothermal regions: most similar hydrogen-rich hydrothermal activity occurs along slowly spreading ridge, {\textless}40 mm year−1. The geological and tectonic aspects of the Kairei and Edmond hydrothermal fields were studied to try to elucidate geological constraints on hydrogen production. Visual observations of the seafloor near Kairei from a submersible revealed olivine-rich plutonic rocks with olivine gabbro-troctolite-dunite assemblages exposed within 15 km of the vent field, with serpentinized ultramafic mantle rocks on the Oceanic Core Complex (OCC). The OCC area might be a recharge zone of Kairei hydrothermal activity producing H2-rich vent fluids. The chaotic seafloor within 30 km of the Kairei field reflects a magma-starved condition persisting there for 1 Myr. Asymmetric geomagnetic and gravity anomalies near the Kairei field can be used to infer that patchy olivine-rich intrusions are scattered within mantle ultramafics, where infiltrated seawater reacts with magma and ultramafic rocks or olivine-rich rocks. The heterogeneous uppermost lithosphere containing shallow olivine-rich rock facies surrounding the Kairei field provides abundant H2 into the vent fluid through serpentinization. The hydrogen-rich Kairei field is hosted by basalt, with mafic-ultramafic olivine-rich lithology; the ordinary, hydrogen-poor Edmond field is hosted by a normal basaltic lithology. The contrasting geochemical signatures of the two fields reported here can also be found in ancient rocks from a juvenile Earth. This suggests that lithology-controlled generation of hydrogen may have operated for a long time and be relevant to the origin of life on Earth.},

	abstract = {As one of the clean energies, hydrogen has attracted more and more global research interest. With the acceleration of hydrogen energy economic construction in China, higher requirements have been put forward for the production and storage of hydrogen. At present, the main way to obtain hydrogen is to produce hydrogen artificially. Whether there is a high content of hydrogen in nature and its origin are the premise for the discovery and utilization of natural hydrogen, but the related research is weak. The discrimination of hydrogen origin, especially deep and shallow source origin, depends mainly on the isotopic composition characteristics of accompanied rare gases, which is difficult to be determined in some cases, the origin of hydrogen is then difficult to be identified. Based on the analysis and analytical results of hydrogen and associated gas content and isotopic composition in different structural parts, this paper analyzes the duration and content variation characteristics of high content hydrogen in the Kansas Basin, USA. A discrimination method for hydrogen genesis based on the relationship between methane and hydrogen content and hydrogen isotopic composition has been proposed, access of hydrogen genesis identification is easier to be achieved. Based on the above research, it is believed that there is a hydrogen supplement mechanism with underground conditions, which can continuously produce high content of natural hydrogen. It is considered that it is a favorable distribution area for high content of hydrogen around the plate collision zone. The hydrogen source can be classified by the hydrogen isotopic composition of -700‰ (VSMOW) and ln(CH$_{\textrm{4}}$/H$_{\textrm{2}}$). Shell source hydrogen has a \textit{δ}D value generally greater than -700‰ and a ln(CH$_{\textrm{4}}$/H$_{\textrm{2}}$) value lower than -8. Mantle derived hydrogen has a \textit{δ}D value generally lower than -700‰ and a ln(CH$_{\textrm{4}}$/H$_{\textrm{2}}$) value greater than -4. Hydrogen remaining after CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ rich fluid is oxidized on the surface has a \textit{δ}D value greater than -700‰ and a ln(CH$_{\textrm{4}}$/H$_{\textrm{2}}$) value greater than -8. After the deep source hydrogen rich fluid is oxidized on the surface, the residual hydrogen has a \textit{δ}D value lower than -700 ‰ and a ln(CH$_{\textrm{4}}$/H$_{\textrm{2}}$) value under -4. This proposed method can quickly classify the origin of hydrogen without determining the composition and isotopic composition of rare gases.},

	abstract = {From a geological perspective, hydrogen has been neglected. It is not as common as biogenic or thermogenic methane, which are ubiquitous in hydrocarbon basins, or carbon dioxide, which is common in geologically active areas of the world. Nevertheless, small flows of hydrogen naturally reach the Earth’s surface, occur in some metal mines and emerge beneath the oceans in a number of places worldwide. These occurrences of hydrogen are associated with abiogenic and biogenic methane, nitrogen and helium. Five geological environments are theoretically promising for exploration based on field, palaeofluid and theoretical evidence: ophiolites (Alpine, Variscan and Caledonian in order of decreasing prospectivity), thinned-crust basins (failed-arm rifts, aulacogens), potash-bearing basins, basement in cratonic areas and the Mid-Atlantic ridge and its fracture zones. The subsurface areas of these environments are relatively poorly known, compared to hydrocarbon basins.
Hydrogen shows may indicate larger reserves in the subsurface, in a similar way to the beginnings of hydrocarbon exploration in the 19th century. The main source of hydrogen is ultramafic rocks, which have experienced serpentinization, although other generation processes have been identified, including biogenic production of hydrogen during very early stages of maturation and radiolysis. There are two main tectonic settings where serpentinization has operated. The main accessible onshore areas are where ophiolites are found tectonically emplaced within fold belts. Potentially much larger investigation areas lie in the subsurface of some ophiolites. These areas generally lie outside hydrocarbon provinces. However, where thrusting has emplaced ophiolites over a hydrocarbon-bearing foreland basin, tests involving sub-thrust conventional hydrocarbon exploration plays could also be employed to search for hydrogen. The other main tectonic setting is in highly extended basins, for example failed rifts or aulacogens, where thick sediments overlie thinned or absent crust above probably serpentinized mantle. These structures occur offshore on continental margins and extend onshore into long-lived rifts which have been reactivated and rejuvenated repeatedly. Conventional seismic reflection data are already available in these areas, but deep subsurface resolution is poor where there are extensive volcanic rocks. Analogues of these occurrences are also found in the deep oceans, along the mid-ocean ridges and offsetting transform faults. Here, thin crust and faulting may facilitate serpentinization of the mantle rocks by seawater ingress.
Further research should aim to identify the extent of the hydrogen flux and its probable dominant role in the abiogenic production of hydrocarbons in Precambrian times, a natural process now largely replaced by biogenic participation. A similar industrial process replicates serpentinization, producing hydrogen and ultimately liquid hydrocarbons on a commercial scale in some countries. It remains to be proved whether a contribution from exploration can be made to any future hydrogen economy.},

With the increasing environmental concerns caused by the continues and high dependence on fossil fuels, more attention is being paid to the research on hydrogen exploration. However, only limited understanding about the geological, genetic as well as distribution characteristics of hydrogen gas has been addressed. In this paper, the formation and enrichment mechanisms of hydrogen gas under different geological conditions were compared, results showed that reservoirs of high-content hydrogen gas may develop in rift system and the front edge of plate subduction zone. By further summarizing the distribution of hydrogen gas in different tectonic members, it is concluded that the plate collision zone and subduction zone and their peripheries controlling the distribution of the development of high-content hydrogen gas and thus the petroliferous basins developed in these tectonic positions have good natural gas preservation conditions, hence are promising for the preservation of high-content hydrogen gas.},

In this paper we explore the use of near surface low enthalpy geothermal energy accessed via commercial and domestic heat pump technology. These resources may become increasingly important in decarbonisation efforts but, while they are renewable, their sustainability is contingent on appropriate management. Here, we introduce a new geothermal circular heat network concept, known as a ‘geobattery’, which redistributes recyclable heat from emitters to users via elevated permeability pathways in the subsurface and offers a platform to manage shallow geothermal resources. If successfully implemented the concept has the potential to provide low carbon, resilient, low-cost heating that is sustainable both in terms of heat pump performance and the shallow geothermal resource. We demonstrate the concept based on the cooling requirements of a case study data centre with existing high energy use and the potential to inject the generated heat into elevated permeability pathways in the shallow subsurface. We show that thermal recharge under these conditions has the potential to arrest subsurface temperature declines associated with closely spaced borehole heat exchangers, ensure the long-term sustainability of shallow geothermal resources for generations to come, and play an important role in the decarbonisation of heating.},

	abstract = {Seasonal storage and extraction of heat in legacy coal mines could help decarbonize the space heating sector of many localities. The modelled evolution of a conceptual mine-water thermal scheme is analysed in this study, involving cyclical storage of heat in an enclosed underground coal mine. Conductive heat transport simulations are performed in a 3D model of a flooded room-and-pillar panel, based on typical mine layouts, to quantify the maximum thermal recovery from the host rock in different scenarios. We show that, by optimizing the seasonal management, from 25\% to 45\% of the energy transferred to the subsurface could be potentially recovered at the end of the first operational year. The modelled heat retrieval, achieved by subsurface cold-water circulation, does not consider the potentially enhancing effect of local advection around mine voids and applies to cases of relatively low dispersal of heat by the regional groundwater flow. The cumulative heat recovered from the modelled host rock could equal the thermal energy provided by the ‘mined’ coal in less than 70 years. A comparison of the value of the original coal ‘mined’, at today’s prices, to a representative value for the heat recycled in the space created by its extraction, suggests that within less than three decades of thermal cycling similar monetary values are reached for the specific conditions modelled.},

Therefore, due to the strain rate decomposition into three parts, nonviscous clays, that is, rate-independent clays, can also be simulated. The incorporation of a loading surface allows to capture the behaviour of normal and overconsolidated clays. The model requires eight material parameters, which are simple to calibrate from standard laboratory tests. In total, 77 simulations of five different clayey-like soils are compared with experimental data. The simulations contain one oedometer test with loading–unloading–reloading cycles, creep and relaxation stages, both undrained and drained triaxial tests in compression and extension, as well as eight incremental response envelopes capturing also the directional response of Beaucaire Marl clay. Some limitations of the model such as the description of temperature effects on the behaviour of clays are also pointed out.},

A model which deals neither with the true hypoplastic nor the true elasto-plastic approach will be proposed herein. Moreover, it combines and establishes the unification of both frameworks and it can be assigned to both of them. It introduces a so called historiotropic surface, responsible for the memory of the soil, but no consistency condition. It also introduces a hypoplastic strain rate, but incorporating the distance to the new surface for its intensity and the back stress tensor. Hence, both the intergranular strain as well as the fabric-dilatancy tensor are omitted, even though the eight-shaped stress hysteresis at cyclic mobility is well reproduced.},

This yield surface is used to describe the intensity of anelastic flow. In the model, the state is fully described by the current stress, the void ratio and a novel back stress-like tensor. This new state variable determines the shape and size of the yield surface and accounts for recent deformation/stress history. The direction of the anelastic flow upon shearing is obtained from a generalization of the Taylor’s dilatancy rule. As a distinctive feature of the model, this dilatancy is able to reproduce the strong contractancy upon reversals observed in experiments without the need of additional state variables. The model corrects some known shortcomings of previous hypoplastic models like overshooting and the excessive accumulation of stress/strain upon strain/stress cycles of small amplitude (ratcheting). Laboratory tests are simulated to show the capabilities of the model to reproduce the soil behaviour under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions after different deformation histories.},

This status quo impedes employing engineering principles to advance the design and operation of biomass handling systems.

This study demonstrates the operational principles of the large chamber cubical triaxial tester and the procedure of triaxial tests to quantify bulk flow behaviors of two milled biomass feedstocks, namely corn stover 2 mm (CS) and Douglas fir 1 mm (DF). The Mohr-Coulomb (MC), Drucker-Prager (DP) and modified Cam-Clay (mCC) models are calibrated for both biomasses. Analysis indicates that CS will exhibit a cohesive flow with a larger cohesion coefficient of MC (3.8 ± 3.5 kPa) than DF (0.42 ± 0.9 kPa) and a larger d value of DP (6.9 kPa) than DF (0.0 kPa), respectively. CS exhibits a higher spring-back index of mCC (0.39 ± 0.05) than DF (0.27 ± 0.05) also suggesting handling issues, which agrees with the experiences in the industry.

	abstract = {A new evaluation method for the dilatancy of fine-grained soils based on monotonic and cyclic undrained triaxial tests has been established using two elasticity approaches: isotropic and transverse isotropic hypoelasticity. The evaluation of two clays, Kaolin and Lower Rhine Clay, with the new method also shows that the dilatancy of fine-grained soils is dependent on the stress ratio, the void ratio, and the straining direction along with the intrinsic material parameters. Similar to sand, we can observe a Phase Transformation Line beyond which further shearing induces a volume increase. A generalization of the Taylor dilatancy rule from direct shear to multiaxial space is established, and an extension accounting for the behaviour of soft soils is proposed. We formulate a simple hypoplastic constitutive relation with a modified flow rule that reproduces the observed dilatant as well as contractant behaviour. Some simulations of monotonic as well as cyclic tests prove the accurate performance of the proposed dilatancy relation.},

	abstract = {Abstract. One of the critical challenges of the green energy transition is resolving the mismatch between energy generation provided by intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar and wind and the demand for energy. There is a need for large amounts of energy storage over a range of time scales (diurnal to seasonal) to better balance energy supply and demand. Subsurface geologic reservoirs provide the potential for storage of hot water that can be retrieved when needed and used for power generation or direct-use applications, such as district heating. It is important to identify potential issues associated with high-temperature reservoir thermal energy storage (HT-RTES) systems so that they can be mitigated, thus reducing the risks of these systems. This paper reviews past experiences from moderate and high-temperature reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) projects, along with hot water and steam flood enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations, to identify technical challenges encountered and evaluate possible ways to address them. Some of the identified technical problems that have impacted system performance include: 1) insufficient site characterization that failed to identify reservoir heterogeneity; 2) scaling resulting from precipitation of minerals having retrograde solubility that form with heating of formation brines; 3) corrosion from low pH or high salinity brines; 4) thermal breakthrough between hot and cold wells due to insufficient spacing. Proper design, characterization, construction, and operational practices can help reduce the risk of technical problems that could lead to reduced performance of these thermal energy storage systems.},

	doi = {10.1017/jfm.2015.412},
	abstract = {In light of the successes of the Navier–Stokes equations in the study of fluid flows, similar continuum treatment of granular materials is a long-standing ambition. This is due to their wide-ranging applications in the pharmaceutical and engineering industries as well as to geophysical phenomena such as avalanches and landslides. Historically this has been attempted through modification of the dissipation terms in the momentum balance equations, effectively introducing pressure and strain-rate dependence into the viscosity. Originally, a popular model for this granular viscosity, the Coulomb rheology, proposed rate-independent plastic behaviour scaled by a constant friction coefficient 𝜇μ\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}mu\}. Unfortunately, the resultant equations are always ill-posed. Mathematically ill-posed problems suffer from unbounded growth of short-wavelength perturbations, which necessarily leads to grid-dependent numerical results that do not converge as the spatial resolution is enhanced. This is unrealistic as all physical systems are subject to noise and do not blow up catastrophically. It is therefore vital to seek well-posed equations to make realistic predictions. The recent 𝜇(𝐼)μ(I)\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}mu\}(I)-rheology is a major step forward, which allows granular flows in chutes and shear cells to be predicted. This is achieved by introducing a dependence on the non-dimensional inertial number 𝐼II in the friction coefficient 𝜇μ\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}mu\}. In this paper it is shown that the 𝜇(𝐼)μ(I)\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}mu\}(I)-rheology is well-posed for intermediate values of 𝐼II, but that it is ill-posed for both high and low inertial numbers. This result is not obvious from casual inspection of the equations, and suggests that additional physics, such as enduring force chains and binary collisions, becomes important in these limits. The theoretical results are validated numerically using two implicit schemes for non-Newtonian flows. In particular, it is shown explicitly that at a given resolution a standard numerical scheme used to compute steady-uniform Bagnold flow is stable in the well-posed region of parameter space, but is unstable to small perturbations, which grow exponentially quickly, in the ill-posed domain.},

	abstract = {In recent years, serpentinized ultramafic rocks have received considerable attention as a source of H2 for hydrogen-based microbial communities and as a potential environment for the abiotic synthesis of methane and other hydrocarbons within the Earth’s crust. Both of these processes rely on the development of strongly reducing conditions and the generation of H2 during serpentinization, which principally results from reaction of water with ferrous iron-rich minerals contained in ultramafic rocks. In this report, numerical models are used to investigate the potential influence of chemical thermodynamics on H2 production during serpentinization. The results suggest that thermodynamic constraints on mineral stability and on the distribution of Fe among mineral alteration products as a function of temperature are likely to be major factors controlling the extent of H2 production. At high temperatures ({\textgreater}∼315°C), rates of serpentinization reactions are fast, but H2 concentrations may be limited by the attainment of stable thermodynamic equilibrium between olivine and the aqueous fluid. Conversely, at temperatures below ∼150°C, H2 generation is severely limited both by slow reaction kinetics and partitioning of Fe(II) into brucite. At 35MPa, peak temperatures for H2 production occur at 200–315°C, indicating that the most strongly reducing conditions will be attained during alteration within this temperature range. Fluids interacting with peridotite in this temperature range are likely to be the most productive sources of H2 for biology, and should also produce the most favorable environments for abiotic organic synthesis. The results also suggest that thermodynamic constraints on Fe distribution among mineral alteration products have significant implications for the timing of magnetization of the ocean crust, and for the occurrence of native metal alloys and other trace minerals during serpentinization.},

	abstract = {The origin of methane and light hydrocarbons (HCs) in natural fluids from serpentinization has commonly been attributed to the abiotic reduction of oxidized carbon by H2 through Fischer-Tropsch-type (FTT) reactions. Multiple experimental serpentinization studies attempted to identify the parameters that control the abiotic production of H2, CH4, and light HC. H2 is systematically and significantly formed in experiments, indicating that its production during serpentinization is well established. However, the large variance in concentration (eight orders of magnitude) is difficult to address because of the large number of parameters that vary from one experiment to another. CH4 and light HC production is much lower and also highly variable, leading to a vivid debate on potential role of metal catalysts and organic contamination. We have built a dataset that includes experimental setups, conditions, reactants, and products from 30 peer-reviewed articles reporting on experimental serpentinization and performed dimensionality reduction and network analysis to achieve an unbiased reading of the literature and fuel the debate. Our analysis distinguishes four experimental communities that highlights usual experimental protocols and the conditions tested so far. As expected, H2 production is mainly controlled by T and P though a strong variability remains within a given P-T range. Accessory metal-bearing phases seem to favor H2 production, while their role as catalyst or reactant is hampered by the lack of mineralogical characterization. CH4 and light HC concentrations are highly variable, uncorrelated to each other, and much lower than concentrations of potential reactants (H2, initial carbon). Accessory phases proposed as FTT catalysts do not enhance CH4 production, confirming the inefficiency of this reaction. CH4 only displays a positive correlation with temperature suggesting a kinetic/thermal control on its forming reaction. The carbon budget of some experiments indicates contamination in agreement with available labeled 13C studies. Salts in initial solutions are possible sources of organic contaminants. Natural systems certainly exploit longer reaction time or other reactional paths to form the observed CH4 and HC. The reducing potential of serpentinization can also produce intermediate metastable carbon phases in liquid or solid as observed in natural samples that should be targeted in future experiments.},

	abstract = {Serpentinization produces molecular hydrogen (H2) that can support communities of microorganisms in hydrothermal fields; H2 results from the oxidation of ferrous iron in olivine and pyroxene into ferric iron, and consequently iron oxide (magnetite or hematite) forms. However, the mechanisms that control H2 and iron oxide formation are poorly constrained. In this study, we performed serpentinization experiments at 311 °C and 3.0 kbar on olivine (with {\textless}5\% pyroxene), orthopyroxene, and peridotite. The results show that serpentine and iron oxide formed when olivine and orthopyroxene individually reacted with a saline starting solution. Olivine-derived serpentine had a significantly lower FeO content (6.57 ± 1.30 wt.\%) than primary olivine (9.86 wt.\%), whereas orthopyroxene-derived serpentine had a comparable FeO content (6.26 ± 0.58 wt.\%) to that of primary orthopyroxene (6.24 wt.\%). In experiments on peridotite, olivine was replaced by serpentine and iron oxide. However, pyroxene transformed solely to serpentine. After 20 days, olivine-derived serpentine had a FeO content of 8.18 ± 1.56 wt.\%, which was significantly higher than that of serpentine produced in olivine-only experiments. By contrast, serpentine after orthopyroxene had a slightly higher FeO content (6.53 ± 1.01 wt.\%) than primary orthopyroxene. Clinopyroxene-derived serpentine contained a significantly higher FeO content than its parent mineral. After 120 days, the FeO content of olivine-derived serpentine decreased significantly (5.71 ± 0.35 wt.\%), whereas the FeO content of orthopyroxene-derived serpentine increased (6.85 ± 0.63 wt.\%) over the same period. This suggests that iron oxide preferentially formed after olivine serpentinization. Pyroxene in peridotite gained some Fe from olivine during the serpentinization process, which may have led to a decrease in iron oxide production. The correlation between FeO content and SiO2 or Al2O3 content in olivine- and orthopyroxene-derived serpentine indicates that aluminum and silica greatly control the production of iron oxide. Based on our results and data from natural serpentinites reported by other workers, we propose that aluminum may be more influential at the early stages of peridotite serpentinization when the production of iron oxide is very low, whereas silica may have a greater control on iron oxide production during the late stages instead.},

However, this valuable natural resource is under-utilized in the economy because the distribution, abundance and origins of H2 are poorly understood. I studied a global dataset of 6246 natural gases with reported H2 concentrations from 16 different geological habitats. The average H2 concentration in all gas samples is 3.5\%, but the median concentration is only 0.01\%. Gases sampled in Mid-Ocean Ridges and in serpentinites have the highest average concentrations of H2 ({\textasciitilde}24\% and {\textasciitilde}21\%, respectively). More than 30 different processes may produce H2 observed in natural gases. Hydrogen isotopic composition (expressed as δ2H-H2 values) may indicate crustal ({\textless}-650‰) or mantle and primordial (from -650‰ to -100‰) sources of H2, or may result from temperature-dependent equilibration of H2 with water. Much of crustal H2 may be sourced by the reactions of serpentinization, while the quantitative significance of other H2-generating processes such as radiolytic decomposition of water and hydrocarbons, fracture-induced reduction of water, petroleum cracking and coal metamorphism remain speculative. Primordial H2 perhaps vents in some volcanic settings. Provided better understanding of H2 abundance and origins in different geological settings should enable the purposeful exploration for geologic H2 and the assessment of its economic resources.},

	abstract = {Reduced (H2- and CH4-rich) and hyperalkaline fluids are products of subsurface reactions accompanying serpentinization of ultramafic rocks. H2 and CH4 produced during serpentinization can fuel microorganisms and support habitable subsurface environments. CH4 is also a potent greenhouse gas and can offset negative greenhouse emissions arising from active CO2 removal accompanying carbon mineralization in ultramafic rocks. However, the rate at which reduced volatiles are delivered to the surface and the rate of reactions that generate these volatiles at low-temperature conditions are poorly known. In this work, we measured H2 and CH4 outgassing rates in several hyperalkaline spring sites in the Samail ophiolite, Oman. H2 and CH4 outgassing in these sites are variable and range up to 70,000 and 7,000 mol yr−1, respectively. CH4 outgassing in spring sites are unlikely to offset negative carbon emissions estimated from active carbon mineralization reactions in the Samail ophiolite. However, diffused CH4 outgassing from peridotite outcrops remain unconstrained. Compositional and isotopic constraints show that volatiles are likely derived from active serpentinization, fluid inclusion decrepitation, or a combination of both. Calculated active serpentinization rates of up to 8 × 10−14 sec−1 account for measured outgassing rates and these are consistent with slow rates expected at low temperatures. In calculations of serpentinization rates, this work uses reaction-path models to account incorporation of both ferrous and ferric iron in the resulting alteration assemblages, which yields ∼0.3 mol H2 kg−1 of ultramafic rock altered, lower than simulations based on iron oxidation to magnetite only. Contribution from decrepitation of H2- and CH4-bearing fluid inclusions is possible but would require much more mass of ultramafic rocks to account for observed outgassing. Further studies can help quantify extents of each source on active outgassing in Oman. Overall, this work shows that low-temperature serpentinization on geologically short timescales can account for observed flux of reduced volatiles in hyperalkaline environments.},

	abstract = {The geochemical energy budgets for high-temperature microbial ecosystems such as occur at Yellowstone National Park have been unclear. To address the relative contributions of different geochemistries to the energy demands of these ecosystems, we draw together three lines of inference. We studied the phylogenetic compositions of high-temperature ({\textgreater}70°C) communities in Yellowstone hot springs with distinct chemistries, conducted parallel chemical analyses, and carried out thermodynamic modeling. Results of extensive molecular analyses, taken with previous results, show that most microbial biomass in these systems, as reflected by rRNA gene abundance, is comprised of organisms of the kinds that derive energy for primary productivity from the oxidation of molecular hydrogen, H2. The apparent dominance by H2-metabolizing organisms indicates that H2 is the main source of energy for primary production in the Yellowstone high-temperature ecosystem. Hydrogen concentrations in the hot springs were measured and found to range up to {\textgreater}300 nM, consistent with this hypothesis. Thermodynamic modeling with environmental concentrations of potential energy sources also is consistent with the proposed microaerophilic, hydrogen-based energy economy for this geothermal ecosystem, even in the presence of high concentrations of sulfide.},

	abstract = {Natural hydrogen is accumulating in the form of “blend gases”, with the association mainly of methane, nitrogen, and helium. The extreme variation of proportion between these four gas compounds is explained through a model of dynamic accumulation, where some compounds as helium are chemically inert in the reservoir, nitrogen almost inert, methane is altered into CO2, and hydrogen is severely altered mainly in protons, and in a smaller degree in methane. All the gas compounds may also leak out of the reservoir, either through advection without any chemical fractionation, or through solubilization in water and diffusion, inducing a variable composition for the residual gas remaining in the accumulation. The model can explain the concomitance of high concentration of helium, clearly accumulated through geological time, with hydrogen, supposedly renewable in human time scales. With the best choice of parameters for the model, the ages of hydrogen accumulation known in the World are small, the hydrogen being diluted more and more in nitrogen and methane through geological time. Diffusive leakage through water appears negligeable compared to advective leakage and compared to hydrogen reactivity in the reservoir. The example of the hydrogen field of Bourakébougou would present an age of 500 years according to the model. Diffusive leakage through water solubilization has a small effect on gas composition. Advective leakage, even not fractionating, has a significant effect on accumulated gas composition, because of its mixing with active deep fluxes. During future production of natural hydrogen accumulations, it is predicted that the proportion of hydrogen should increase during production time, whereas the helium and nitrogen concentrations should decrease.},

	abstract = {Molecular hydrogen (H2) released during serpentinization of mantle rocks is one of the main fuels for chemosynthetic life. Processes of H2 production at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges (MORs) have received much attention in the past. Less well understood is serpentinization at passive continental margins where different rock types are involved (lherzolite instead of harzburgite/dunite at MORs) and the alteration temperatures tend to be lower ({\textless}200°C vs. {\textgreater}200°C). To help closing this knowledge gap we investigated drill core samples from the West Iberia margin. Lherzolitic compositions and spinel geochemistry indicate that the exhumed peridotites resemble sub-continental lithospheric mantle. The rocks are strongly serpentinized, mainly consist of serpentine with little magnetite, and are generally brucite-free. Serpentine can be uncommonly Fe-rich, with XMg = Mg/(Mg + Fe) {\textless} 0.8, and shows distinct compositional trends toward a cronstedtite endmember. Bulk rock and silicate fraction Fe(III)/∑Fe ratios are 0.6–0.92 and 0.58–0.8, respectively; our data show that 2/3 of the ferric Fe is accounted for by Fe(III)-serpentine. Mass balance and thermodynamic calculations suggest that the sample’s initial serpentinization produced ∼120 to {\textgreater}300 mmol H2 per kg rock. The cold, late-stage weathering of the serpentinites at the seafloor caused additional H2 formation. These results suggest that the H2 generation potential evolves during the transition from continental break-up to ultraslow and, eventually, slow MOR spreading. Metamorphic phase assemblages systematically vary between these settings, which has consequences for H2 yields during serpentinization. At magma-poor rifted margins and ultraslow-spreading MORs, serpentine hosts most Fe(III). Hydrogen yields of 120 to {\textgreater}300 mmol and 50–150 mmol H2 per kg rock, respectively, may be expected at temperatures of {\textless}200°C. At slow-spreading MORs, in contrast, serpentinization may produce 200–350 mmol H2, most of which is related to magnetite formation at {\textgreater}200°C. Since, in comparison to slow-spreading MORs, geothermal gradients at magma-poor margins and ultraslow-spreading MORs are lower, larger volumes of low-temperature serpentinite should form in these settings. Serpentinization of lherzolitic rocks at magma-poor margins should produce particularly high amounts of H2 under conditions within the habitable zone. Magma-poor margins may hence be more relevant environments for hydrogenotrophic microbial life than previously thought.},

We investigated factors controlling this phenomenon, including rock composition, pH, temperature, sterilization method, reducing agents, and product removal. Ferrous silicate minerals were found to be the basalt components responsible for H2 production from anaerobic water−rock interactions. H2 evolution was faster at pH {\textless} 7 but occurred from pH 5 to pH 11, which covers the pH range (7−10) measured in CRB groundwaters. The onset of H2 evolution coincided with the appearance of dissolved Fe2+, and an apparent alkaline inhibition could be alleviated by the addition of excess FeCl2. This may reflect, in part, the low redox conditions needed for H2 evolution and suggests that H2 may be controlled by reaction rates of ferrous silicate minerals. Rates were higher at 60 °C than at 30 °C, suggesting that the geothermal gradient may lead to increased H2 production at depth. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that basalt−redox reactions support primary production by microorganisms in some terrestrial subsurface environments.},

	abstract = {Serpentinization plays a key role on the evolution of the physicochemical properties of the mantle lithosphere. The rate of serpentinization reactions is controlled by the transport of fluid, which itself depends on volume change during reaction. Element transfer can strongly modify the magnitude and sign of volume change. Here, we measure solid volume change and element transport perpendicular to a serpentine vein in a serpentinized dunite collected at depth during the Oman Drilling Project. The sample is extensively replaced (extent of reaction {\textgreater} 80\%) by a serpentine/brucite mixture parallel to a main serpentine vein network. The Mg content of serpentine and brucite indicates reaction with a small amount of fluid at temperatures below 100°C. Concentrations of fluid-mobile trace elements (Na, Ca, Sr, Rb, and Ba) decrease perpendicular to the main vein. Primary olivine contains parallel platelets of a clinopyroxene/magnetite symplectite. Tomography at the nanoscale reveals that these inclusions do not react during serpentinization but are cracked and displaced. We use these inert markers to measure a 59\% to 74\% positive volume change that is close to the 52\% expected for reaction in a closed system. Chemical data indicate no change in major element composition during reaction except for the addition of water. The initial olivine zoning in Al, Ti, V, Sc, and Cr is still preserved in serpentine and brucite. Serpentinization can thus be a local replacement process during which the solid volume homogeneously increases at the micrometer scale and the transport of aqueous species is limited.},

	abstract = {Reliable values of static temperature are important for a number of reasons. For example, they are required in designing deep-well cementing programs and in analyzing reservoir fluid properties. Though many engineers hate discouraged the use of recorded log temperatures, these log temperatures can be used to predict static temperature.Static formation temperature should be determined as accurately as possible for a number of reasons. In-situ sauration distributions computed from resistivity logs require accurate formation water resistivities that depend on temperature. Reliable estimates of bottom-hole temperatures are important in designing deep-well cementing programs and in evaluating reservoir-fluid formation volume factors. Also, the determination of static temperature is necessary for establishing geothermal gradients that can be used to estimate the temperatures of deeper zones. More recently, new exploration techniques have used temperature as a mappable proximity parameter. proximity parameter.Unfortunately, the temperatures recorded during logging operations frequently are not static temperatures. The recorded values are too low. These low temperatures result because the circulating mud temperature frequently is much less than the formation temperature. Schoeppel and Gilarranz reported that early investigators had discouraged the use of bottom-hole temperatures obtained from logs under the assumption that the temperatures would not be correct because the mud and the formation were not in thermal equilibrium.More recently, however, Timko and Fertl suggested that the temperatures recorded while running a series of logs can be interpreted to estimate static formation temperature. They recommend use of a Horner temperature plot, similar to the conventional pressure buildup method, plot, similar to the conventional pressure buildup method, for estimating static formation temperature. Timko and Fertl demonstrate the apparent applicability of the technique with an example. Significantly, we have been unable to find any theoretical justification for an analysis of this type. However, we have seen field cases where the technique gives satisfactory results. The accuracy of this analysis was especially surprising when it was concluded that the two methods - pressure build-up and temperature buildup - are not completely analogous. Thus, the chief objective of the present study was to determine under what conditions the Horner temperature plot can be used to estimate static temperature.Pressure Buildup Pressure Buildup The equation that describes pressure behavior at each point at any time in the well drainage area is point at any time in the well drainage area is(1)2p 1 p c p----- + ---- ---- = ------ ------r2 r r k tEq. 1 frequently and referred to as the "diffusivity" equation because of its similarity to the diffusivity equation in the heat-transfer literature.

	abstract = {Serpentinization of olivine-rich ultramafic rocks is increasingly recognized to have been widespread in the solar system throughout its history. This process has gained particular attention among planetary scientists because it generates molecular hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4), compounds that can supply metabolic energy to biological communities and contribute to greenhouse warming of planetary atmospheres. While serpentinization of olivine has been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies over the years, this work has focused almost exclusively on the magnesium-rich olivine that is characteristic of the terrestrial mantle. In contrast, very few studies have examined serpentinization of the more iron-enriched olivine compositions that may be more common in other rocky planetary bodies in the solar system. Accordingly, a series of thermodynamic models were constructed to investigate secondary mineral formation and H2 generation during serpentinization of olivine as a function of Fe content and temperature. The results show that serpentinization of Fe-rich olivine is capable of generating substantially greater amounts of H2 per mole than is observed for serpentinization of Mg-rich olivine, by a factor of two to ten depending on temperature and olivine composition. For all olivine compositions, H2 is generated from ferric Fe incorporated into both magnetite and serpentine at higher temperatures; however, it is derived exclusively from precipitation of serpentine at lower temperatures as brucite replaces magnetite in the equilibrium secondary mineral assemblage. Serpentine and brucite formed during serpentinization are predicted to become increasingly enriched in Fe with greater Fe content of the original olivine, although the serpentine has proportionally lower Fe contents than the olivine while brucite has somewhat higher Fe contents. Between 10\% and 40\% of the Fe partitioned into serpentine occurs in the ferric state (FeIII), which accounts for a substantial fraction of H2 production for most conditions. In addition, the maximum temperature at which olivine undergoes serpentinization decreases with increasing Fe content of the olivine, so that Fe-enriched olivine can remain stable to lower temperatures when compared with more Mg-rich olivine compositions. Overall, the results indicate that serpentinization on other planetary bodies may have a substantially greater capacity to supply H2 to support biological communities and enhance atmospheric greenhouse warming than analogous processes on Earth.},

	abstract = {Serpentinization produces molecular hydrogen (H2) that is capable of supporting communities of microorganisms in hydrothermal fields, which suggests that serpentinization may be closely related to the origin of life at the early history of the Earth and possibly other planets. In this study, serpentinization experiments were performed at 300 °C and 3.0 kbar with natural olivine and peridotite as starting reactants to quantify the influence of acidic and alkaline solutions on the processes of serpentinization. The results reveal that acidic and alkaline solutions greatly influence molecular hydrogen (H2) generation and the rates of serpentinization. Acidic (pH = 2.50) and alkaline solutions (pH = 13.5) increased H2 production and the rates of peridotite serpentinization. Highly acidic solutions (2 M HCl), however, decreased the production of H2 after peridotite serpentinization by around two orders of magnitude. The decrease in H2 production was associated with a sharp decline in the rates of reaction; e.g., when peridotite was reacted with neutral solutions (0.5 M NaCl), 88\% of reaction progress was achieved after an experimental duration of 27 days, and the reaction extent decreased by {\textasciitilde}50\% for experiments with highly acidic solutions (2 M HCl) over the same period. In contrast, for experiments with solely olivine, highly acidic solutions (2 M HCl) promoted the rates of olivine serpentinization and H2 production. The contrasting effect of highly acidic solutions (2 M HCl) on the processes of olivine and peridotite serpentinization may reflect the influence of pyroxene minerals, which could release SiO2 during peridotite serpentinization and, consequently, hydrogen generation and reaction rates may decrease. The experimental results of this study suggest that H2 production and the rates of serpentinization can be greatly influenced by acidic and alkaline solutions and co-existing minerals (e.g., pyroxene).},

	abstract = {A series of three laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate how pH affects reaction pathways and rates during serpentinization. Two experiments were conducted under strongly alkaline conditions using olivine as reactant at 200 and 230°C, and the results were compared with previous studies performed using the same reactants and methods at more neutral pH. For both experiments, higher pH resulted in more rapid serpentinization of the olivine and generation of larger amounts of H2 for comparable reaction times. Proportionally greater amounts of Fe were partitioned into brucite and chrysotile and less into magnetite in the experiments conducted at higher pH. In a third experiment, alkaline fluids were injected into an ongoing experiment containing olivine and orthopyroxene to raise the pH from circumneutral to strongly alkaline conditions. Increasing the pH of the olivine-orthopyroxene experiment resulted in an immediate and steep increase in H2 production, and led to far more extensive reaction of the primary minerals compared to a similar experiment conducted under more neutral conditions. The results suggest that the development of strongly alkaline conditions in actively serpentinizing systems promotes increased rates of reaction and H2 production, enhancing the flux of H2 available to support biological activity in these environments.

Serpentinization affects the physical and chemical properties of oceanic lithosphere, represents one of the major mechanisms driving mass exchange between the mantle and the Earth’s surface, and is central to current origin of life hypotheses as well as the search for microbial life on the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn. In spite of increasing interest in the serpentinization process by researchers in diverse fields, the rates of serpentinization and the controlling factors are poorly understood. Here we use a novel in situ experimental method involving olivine micro-reactors and show that the rate of serpentinization is strongly controlled by the salinity (water activity) of the reacting fluid and demonstrate that the rate of serpentinization of olivine slows down as salinity increases and H2O activity decreases.},

	abstract = {The reactivity of ultramafic rocks under hydrothermal conditions controls chemical fluxes at the interface between the internal and external reservoirs of silicate planets. On Earth, hydration of ultramafic rocks is ubiquitous and operates from deep subduction zones to shallow lithospheric environments where it considerably affects the physical and chemical properties of rocks and can interact with the biosphere. This process also has key emerging societal implications, such as the production of hydrogen as a source of carbon-free energy. To date, the chemical model systems used to reproduce olivine hydrothermal alteration lead to the formation of serpentine with sluggish reaction rates. Here, we use in situ diamond-anvil cell experiments and show that the presence of aluminum in hydrothermal fluids increases the rate of olivine serpentinization by one to two orders of magnitude. Aluminum increases the solubility of olivine and enhances the precipitation of aluminous serpentine. After two days, olivine crystals were fully transformed to aluminous serpentine under conditions typical for natural hydrothermal environments, i.e., 200 and 300 °C, 200 MPa. This result motivates a re-evaluation of the natural rates of olivine serpentinization and of olivine hydrolysis in general in a wide range of settings. This discovery also opens the potential of the serpentinization reaction for industrial scale production of hydrogen at economically feasible timescales and temperature.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Pressure pulses generated by sparks in water-filled boreholes generate hydraulic fractures in the dynamic regime. Using triaxially stressed model tests, we investigated the potential for multiple fracturing and the expected size of the fractures. In the tests, we determined the power level at which the pulse initiates a fracture and the final fracture geometry after applying many pulses. A dynamic fracture model is used to explain the attenuation of the pulses. Dynamic fracturing is still poorly understood. Lab tests are needed to benchmark simulation codes that predict fracture length and multiple fractures.In the tests, we varied the number of notches in the wellbore, stress and rock type. Tests on blocks of cement and oil shale show that pulses of a few kJoule can generate pulses up to 50 MPa that induce multiple fractures and create fairly large fractures, depending on rock type. Bi-wing fractures were generated without notching the borehole. With 4-8 notches the fractures initiated from the notches. Attenuation of the pulses was found to depend mainly on turbulent friction in the fractures.Pulse power has the advantage that it can generate many pulses in the same zone and can be applied quickly to stimulate multiple zones. This may be favorable compared with propellant fracturing. Pulse power fracturing may be used for stimulating very tight reservoirs, for improving breakdown or for initiating fractures at specific locations.},

Uniformly depleted harzburgites and dunites from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 15°N show variable extents of static serpentinization. They reveal a simple sequence of reactions: serpentinization of olivine and development of a typical mesh texture with serpentine-brucite mesh rims, followed by replacement of olivine mesh centers by serpentine and brucite. The serpentine mesh rims on relic olivine are devoid of magnetite. Conversely, domains in the rock that are completely serpentinized show abundant magnetite. We propose that low-fluid-flux serpentinization of olivine to serpentine and ferroan brucite is followed by later stages of serpentinization under more open-system conditions and formation of magnetite by the breakdown of ferroan brucite. Modeling of this sequence of reactions can account for covariations in magnetic susceptibility and grain density of the rocks.},

	abstract = {Aqueous dihydrogen (H2,aq) is produced in copious amounts when seawater interacts with peridotite and H2O oxidizes ferrous iron in olivine to ferric iron in secondary magnetite and serpentine. Poorly understood in this process is the partitioning of iron and its oxidation state in serpentine, although both impose an important control on dihydrogen production. We present results of detailed petrographic, mineral chemical, magnetic and Mößbauer analyses of partially to fully serpentinized peridotites from the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 209, Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) 15°N area. These results are used to constrain the fate of iron during serpentinization and are compared with phase equilibria considerations and peridotite–seawater reaction path models. In samples from Hole 1274A, mesh-rims reveal a distinct in-to-out zoning from brucite at the interface with primary olivine, followed by a zone of serpentine+brucite±magnetite and finally serpentine+magnetite in the outermost mesh-rim. The compositions of coexisting serpentine (Mg\# 95) and brucite (Mg\# 80) vary little throughout the core. About 30–50\% of the iron in serpentine/brucite mesh-rims is trivalent, irrespective of subbasement depth and protolith (harzburgite versus dunite). Model calculations suggest that both partitioning and oxidation state of iron are very sensitive to temperature and water-to-rock ratio during serpentinization. At temperatures above 330°C the dissolution of olivine and coeval formation of serpentine, magnetite and dihydrogen depends on the availability of an external silica source. At these temperatures the extent of olivine serpentinization is insufficient to produce much hydrogen, hence conditions are not reducing enough to form awaruite. At T{\textless}330°C, hydrogen generation is facilitated by the formation of brucite, as dissolution of olivine to form serpentine, magnetite and brucite requires no addition of silica. The model calculations suggest that the iron distribution observed in serpentine and brucite is consistent with formation temperatures ranging from {\textless}150 to 250°C and bulk water-to-rock ratios between 0.1 and 5. These conditions coincide with peak hydrogen fugacities during serpentinization and are conducive to awaruite formation during main stage serpentinization. The development of the common brucite rims around olivine is either due to an arrested reaction olivine→brucite→serpentine+brucite, or reflects metastable olivine–brucite equilibria developing in the strong gradient in silica activity between orthopyroxene (talc–serpentine) and olivine (serpentine–brucite).},

This is the first of a series of papers describing the development and implementation of a comprehensive and internally consistent database of the dissolution rates of the major rock-forming minerals. In this paper, we describe the retrieval and regression of the dissolution rates of the primary rock-forming silicates, including quartz and other SiO2 polymorphs, feldspars, pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas, volcanic glass, and olivines. Owing to the limited fluid chemistry data available for many of the published experimental studies, BET surface area normalized mineral and most glass dissolution rates (r) were regressed usingr=∑iAiaH+nieEaiRT1−exp−AσRT where Ai stands for pre-exponential factors, aH+ corresponds to the hydrogen ion activity, ni refers to reaction orders, T designates absolute temperature, R denotes the gas constant, Eai represents activation energies, σ stands for Temkin's average stoichiometric number, and A denotes the chemical affinity of the dissolution reaction. Where relevant data were lacking, rates were extrapolated assuming that mineral dissolution follows similar trends within the same mineral group. Regression was performed using least-squares algorithms. The average difference between calculated and measured rates ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 log units depending on the mineral. The obtained rate equations were implemented into the carbfix.dat database for direct use in the PHREEQC software but can be extended to other geochemical modeling software, such as TOUGHREACT.},

All rates were measured in mixed flow reactors and exhibited stoichiometric dissolution. Measured rates are found to be independent of both aqueous magnesium and silica concentrations. The temperature dependence of the pH 2 forsterite dissolution rates obtained in this study is consistent with an Arrhenius equation of the formr=AAexp(−EA/RT)where r signifies the overall forsterite steady state dissolution rate, AA refers to a pre-exponential factor equal to 0.190 mol cm−2 s−1, EA designates an activation energy equal to 63.8 kJ/mol, R represents the gas constant, and T denotes absolute temperature. The observed variation of forsterite dissolution rates with aqueous composition is interpreted to originate from its dissolution mechanism. The forsterite structure consists of isolated silica tetrahedra that are branched together by magnesium octahedra chains. MgO bonds apparently break more rapidly than SiO bonds in this structure. The breaking of octahedra chain linking MgO bonds, which is apparently catalyzed by hydrogen ion adsorption at acidic conditions, leads directly to the destruction of the mineral. As the rate-controlling precursor complex for this mineral is formed by a hydrogen adsorption reaction, forsterite dissolution rates are unaffected by aqueous Mg and Si activities.},

Laboratory experiments confirm relatively rapid chemical reaction of CO2-saturated pore water with basalts to form stable carbonate minerals. Calculations suggest a sufficiently short time frame for onset of carbonate precipitation after CO2 injection that verification of in situ mineralization rates appears feasible in field pilot studies.

Therefore olivine reaction is a promising process for carbon sequestration, to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mineral form. The purpose of this study was (1) to explore the composition, structure and reactivity of olivine surfaces during exposure to air and to water at ambient conditions, (2) to investigate the effect of elevated CO2 pressure and temperature, and (3) to identify the secondary minerals. Olivine surfaces have been examined with atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), before and after reaction with CO2. Experiments were carried out in pure water equilibrated with CO2 at total pressures up to 80bars, at temperatures 25°C and 120°C and both in the absence and presence of oxygen. New formation products appeared on the olivine surface as a homogeneous layer of bumps, less than 100nm in diameter, within hours of exposure to air. Olivine crystals, exposed to water, dissolved and secondary minerals formed within days. Colonies of bacteria populated olivine surfaces on samples stored in water for more than 4days at room temperature. Loosely attached material formed on olivine surfaces and could easily be scraped away with the AFM tip. A red precipitate formed when crystals where reacted at increased temperatures and CO2 partial pressures for less than 4days. The new phases were identified as goethite, hematite, silica and carbonate minerals. Olivine surfaces oxidize and iron oxides form even when oxygen is absent, suggesting hydrolysis, where water is converted to hydrogen and oxygen.},

	abstract = {The dissolution rates of Fo100 and Fo91 in aqueous solutions in the pH range 2–12.4 at 25°C have been measured using fluidized bed and batch reactors. Rates depend upon the pH, the partial pressure of CO2, and the presence of organic ligands. At low PCO2 (≤10−4.5 atm) with no organic ligands present, the rate of olivine dissolution, R, is given by R (mol cm−2 s−1) = 9.07 × 10−12aH+0.54 + 5.25 × 10−15 + 2.33 × 10−17aH+−0.31, where aH+ is the activity of H+ in solution. However in basic solutions, when the partial pressure of CO2 is equal to atmospheric levels (PCO2 = 10−3.5 atm), olivine dissolution rates are nearly pH independent throughout the pH range 6–12 and are about equal to the minimum rate of dissolution under CO2 purged conditions. At pH 11 the presence of atmospheric levels of CO2 reduces the dissolution rate by over an order of magnitude (to 10−14.1 mol cm−2 s−1). Apparently, positive charge on the olivine surface can be neutralized by increasing PCO2. In contrast, experiments conducted in the acidic and near neutral pH ranges indicate that organic ligands chelate surface Mg causing an increase in the olivine dissolution rate when present. Organic ligand effects are greatest in the near neutral pH domain. For example, at pH 4 dissolution rates are increased by 0.75 log units (to 10−12.25 mol cm−2 s−1) in solutions of 10−3 molar ascorbic acid or 0.05 molar potassium acid phthalate over rates measured in organic free solutions. The chelation effect becomes less important as pH decreases. Rates at pH 2 in the presence of these organic ligands are indistinguishable from those measured without organics.},

	abstract = {We conducted hydrothermal experiments at 300°C and at pressure varying from 2.2 to 3.4 kbar to study the effect of fluid salinity on the coupling between molecular hydrogen (H2) formation and olivine serpentinization, where peridotite and olivine with 25–50 μm of starting grain sizes were reacted with pure H2O and saline solutions (0.5, 1.5, and 3.3 M NaCl). Serpentine, the main hydrous mineral in most experiments, was quantified according to calibration curves based on Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses. Compared to pure H2O, saline solutions promote the hydrothermal alteration of olivine and peridotite. For experiments with peridotite and pure H2O, 67\% of reaction extent was achieved after 14 days, which increased to 89\% in experiments with medium-salinity solutions (1.5 M NaCl) over the same period. Medium- and high-salinity solutions inhibit H2 formation during serpentinization, which is associated with the serpentinization of pyroxene especially clinopyroxene. The redox conditions were constrained according to the equilibrium H2,aq = H2,g, and very reducing conditions were achieved during the serpentinization of olivine and peridotite. This study is the first to show iowaite formation directly from peridotite serpentinization, indicating alkaline solutions. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that the hydrolysis of NaCl (NaCl + H2O = HCl + NaOH) may yield alkaline solutions, due to higher dissociation constants of NaOH compared to HCl. This study suggests that chlorine greatly influences the serpentinization of olivine and peridotite in natural geological settings. It also indicates that iowaite formation may not require oxidizing conditions as previously thought.},

	abstract = {Partially serpentinized peridotites in the Samail ophiolite in the Sultanate of Oman currently undergo low temperature alteration and hydration both at shallow levels, with water recently in contact with the atmosphere, and at depth, with anoxic, reducing fluids. However, it is unclear how changes in the distribution and oxidation state of Fe are driving the production of energy-rich gases such as hydrogen and methane detected in peridotite catchments. We track the Fe transformations in a suite of outcrop samples representing a subset of the spectrum of least to most altered end-members of the Oman peridotites. We use microscale mineralogical and geochemical analyses including QEMSCAN, Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping, and electron microprobe wavelength dispersive spectroscopy. The less-altered peridotites possess a diversity of Fe-bearing phases including relict primary minerals (e.g. olivine, pyroxene, chromite) and secondary phases (e.g. serpentine and brucite). Raman spectroscopy and electron microprobe data (Si/(Mg + Fe)) indicate that much of the serpentine is significantly intergrown with brucite on the sub-micron scale. These data also indicate that the Fe content of the brucite ranges from 10 to 20 wt\% FeO. The mineral assemblage of the highly reacted rocks is less diverse, dominated by serpentine and carbonate while olivine and brucite are absent. Magnetite is relatively rare and mainly associated with chromite. Goethite and hematite, both Fe(III)-hydroxides, were also identified in the highly altered rocks. Whole rock chemical analyses reflect these mineralogical differences and show that Fe in the partially serpentinized samples is on average more reduced (∼0.40–0.55 Fe3+/FeTotal) than Fe in the highly reacted rocks (∼0.85–0.90 Fe3+/FeTotal). We propose that olivine, brucite, chromite and, perhaps, serpentine in the less-altered peridotites act as reactive phases during low temperature alteration of the Oman peridotite. The pervasive oxidation of Fe(II) in the less-altered peridotites to Fe(III) in the most-altered peridotites during water-rock reaction in the subsurface of the Samail ophiolite may produce H2 which will influence the development of microbial energy sources and habitats, and carbon cycling and sequestration within the (ultra)mafic ocean crust.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is commonly produced during the high-temperature hydration of mafic and ultramafic rocks, owing to the oxidation of reduced iron present in the minerals. Hydrothermal hydrogen is known to sustain microbial communities in submarine vent and terrestrial hot-spring systems. However, the rates and mechanisms of hydrogen generation below temperatures of 150 °C are poorly constrained. As such, the existence and extent of hydrogen-fuelled ecosystems in subsurface terrestrial and oceanic aquifers has remained uncertain. Here, we report results from laboratory experiments in which we reacted ground ultramafic and mafic rocks and minerals—specifically peridotite, pyroxene, olivine and magnetite—with anoxic fluids at 55 and 100 °C, and monitored hydrogen gas production. We used synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence and X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy to identify changes in the speciation of iron in the materials. We report a strong correlation between molecular hydrogen generation and the presence of spinel phases—oxide minerals with the general formula [M2+M23+]O4 and a cubic crystal structure—in the reactants. We also identify Fe(III)-(hydr)oxide reaction products localized on the surface of the spinel phases, indicative of iron oxidation. We propose that the transfer of electrons between Fe(II) and water adsorbed to the spinel surfaces promotes molecular hydrogen generation at low temperatures. We suggest that these localized sites of hydrogen generation in ultramafic aquifers in the oceanic and terrestrial crust could support hydrogen-based microbial life.},

	abstract = {The Oman ophiolite consists of several massifs cropping out along a 500 km long band trending NW–SE along the coast of Oman; it is one of the best exposed sections of oceanic crust and mantle in the world. There is a gradient in igneous processes and composition in the ophiolite, with the northern massifs recording a polygenetic igneous history involving an increasingly important subduction component, whereas the southern massifs were formed primarily via a mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB)-like, single-stage process at a submarine spreading ridge. In this study we use geochemical data from Wadi Tayin, which is one of the southern massifs of the Oman ophiolite, to constrain the composition and genesis of oceanic crust and upper mantle. The Wadi Tayin harzburgites are residues of partial melting that are as depleted as the most depleted mid-ocean ridge peridotites. They have low middle- to heavy rare earth element ratios, most probably reflecting melting close to and beyond the exhaustion of clinopyroxene. Like many abyssal peridotites, the Wadi Tayin samples show enrichment in highly incompatible elements, giving rise to U-shaped MORB-normalized trace element patterns. We favor the idea that this is caused by enrichment of highly incompatible elements along grain boundaries in peridotite, which may be the result of near-equilibrium partitioning between grain boundaries and grain interiors, rather than disequilibrium processes. Equilibrium partitioning between crystals and grain boundaries during melting and melt extraction is also our preferred explanation for ubiquitous high Pb contents relative to Ce and La in our samples as well as in most abyssal peridotites. The Wadi Tayin samples record substantial variability in terms of osmium isotopic composition and platinum group element (PGE) concentrations. The more radiogenic nature of the dunites and impregnated peridotites compared with the residual harzburgites may be due to relatively high 187Os/188Os in melt transported through the dunites. The presence of residual peridotites with whole-rock osmium isotopic compositions less radiogenic than MORB may be explained by melting of a veined (upwelling) mantle forming mixed melts in which much of the Os derives from veins with high Re/Os in a matrix of previously depleted peridotite. An important result of this study is that the shallowest samples are refertilized (i.e. anomalously enriched in incompatible elements), and record relatively high metamorphic closure temperatures. These observations suggest that migrating melt underwent crystallization during rapid cooling in the uppermost mantle during and immediately after ridge magmatism. A variety of geothermometers all yield the result that the stratigraphically highest harzburgites equilibrated at higher temperature than the deeper ones. The systematic decrease in closure temperature with increasing depth below the Moho transition zone probably reflects systematic variation in cooling rate as a function of depth in the mantle section. We hypothesize that the refertilization and higher closure temperatures recorded by the uppermost mantle samples are linked. More rapid cooling led to higher closure temperatures, and to partial crystallization of migrating melts in the shallowest part of the mantle section, yielding slightly elevated abundances of elements such as Ca and Na, and incompatible trace elements.},

	abstract = {The origin and parental magma for layered cumulates in the Lower Banded series (LBS) and the J-M Reef Pd-Pt deposit of the Stillwater Complex remains poorly constrained. We present whole-rock lithogeochemistry and mineral chemistry from LBS rocks collected from drill holes and surface samples from the Mountain View area of the complex that in total span nearly the entirety of the LBS stratigraphy. Excess S, Pt, and Pd in the noritic and gabbronoritic cumulates of the LBS indicate that small amounts of high tenor sulfide liquid generated at very low degrees of sulfide oversaturation were ubiquitous parts of the cumulate assemblage. We show that a simple two-stage thermodynamic model of assimilation-batch crystallization of a komatiitic parental magma in the lower crust, produces a close match to a common suite of fine-grained gabbronorite dikes and sills that intrude both the complex and its footwall. After fractionating ultramafic cumulates in the lower crust, the model contaminated komatiitic liquid produces upper crustal cumulates by batch crystallization en route to or at the level of the intrusion. The modeled rocks have compositions and mineral assemblages closely resembling pyroxenite of the Bronzitite zone and both norite and gabbronorite cumulates in the lower LBS. The trends from the Bronzitite zone through Norite zone I and Gabbronorite zone I can be understood as the result of deposition of crystals from successive batches of the same contaminated parental magma, with an upward trend toward greater amounts of cooling before the separation of crystals from liquid. The olivine-bearing suite of Olivine-bearing zone I, which includes the J-M Reef, can be modeled by partial remelting of the same norite and gabbronorite cumulates due to a temporarily increased flux of hot, moderately less contaminated LBS parental magma that infiltrated partially molten cumulates because its density exceeded that of the interstitial liquid. This model suggests that infiltration of hot Mg-rich parental liquid into moderately PGE-enriched footwall cumulates may be fundamental to the formation of the extremely high tenor sulfide mineralization in the J-M Reef ore zone, and perhaps other reef-type deposits worldwide. The same metal tenors that would require silicate/sulfide mass ratios (i.e., R-factors) of 105 to 106 in a single stage of equilibration would be attained during this second stage of interaction by the incremental infiltration and passage of LBS parental magma through previously sulfide saturated cumulate mush.},

	abstract = {If the potential for a boom in the global hydrogen economy is realized, there will be an increase in the need for accurate hydrogen thermodynamic property standards. Based on current and anticipated needs, new fundamental equations of state for parahydrogen, normal hydrogen, and orthohydrogen were developed to replace the existing property models. To accurately predict thermophysical properties near the critical region and in liquid states, the quantum law of corresponding states was applied to improve the normal hydrogen and orthohydrogen formulations in the absence of available experimental data. All three equations of state have the same maximum pressure of 2000MPa and upper temperature limit of 1000K. Uncertainty estimates in this paper can be considered to be estimates of a combined expanded uncertainty with a coverage factor of 2 for primary data sets. The uncertainty in density is 0.04\% in the region between 250 and 450K and at pressures up to 300MPa. The uncertainties of vapor pressures and saturated liquid densities vary from 0.1\% to 0.2\%. Heat capacities are generally estimated to be accurate to within 1\%, while speed-of-sound values are accurate to within 0.5\% below 100MPa.},

	abstract = {In many basins, hydrogen-emitting structures are now observed, but the estimation of the H2 flow leading to their formation remains poorly constrained since all data show that the H2 emissions are variable in space and time. We present here the data of a long-term monitoring campaign with a high density of permanent hydrogen detectors installed in 2 structures in the Minas Gerais State (Brazil). Results show that two kinds of signals are recorded, large sporadic pulses that affect the H2 content of the soil for one or two days and smaller ones, with a daily periodicity, that last 6 h and during which the near surface soil concentration usually does not exceed 200 ppm. This last signal is very regular in frequency, less in amount, and the daily maximum happens around noon or in the early afternoon. We interpret the large pulses as evidences of a deep hydrogen flux, leaking either from a reservoir located in the subsurface, from an aquifer which is degassing or, although it seems unlikely, directly from the H2 generation area. The time correlation between the pulse and the increase of the daily signal suggests that this last one corresponds to the slow release of the gas that has been captured by the soil during its transport towards the surface. This daily signal is most likely influenced by external factors such as atmospheric pressure and sub-surface bacterial activity. In map view, the lack of correlation between the highest hydrogen concentrations over time suggests that the soil is very heterogeneous and that preferential pathways exist. The results confirm that long-term monitoring, over a few months, is mandatory to catch a certain number of high pulses and so to have a better estimation of the real flow. Data also suggests that sensors with a large concentration range should be used (from 10 to several 104 ppm). Even if quantification of leakage doesn't help to quantify the subsurface reserves, these new data allow a more precise evaluation of the quantity of H2 released in surface by these structures, few hundred of kilo per day, and confirm the high H2 prospectivity of this basin.},

These assessments are becoming an increasingly challenging computational task since we aim to resolve models with high resolutions in space and time, to consider complex coupled partial differential equations, and to estimate uncertainties, which often requires many realizations. Machine learning methods are becoming a very popular method for the construction of surrogate 5 models to address these computational issues. However, they also face major challenges in producing explainable, scalable, interpretable and robust models. In this manuscript, we evaluate the perspectives of geoscience applications of physics-based machine learning, which combines physics-based and data-driven methods to overcome the limitations of each approach taken alone. Through three designated examples (from the fields of geothermal energy, geodynamics, and hydrology), we show that the non-intrusive reduced basis method as a physics-based machine learning approach is able to 10 produce highly precise surrogate models that are explainable, scalable, interpretable, and robust.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Nonetheless, neural networks provide a solid foundation to respect physics-driven or knowledge-based constraints during training. Generally speaking, there are three distinct neural network frameworks to enforce the underlying physics: (i) physics-guided neural networks (PgNNs), (ii) physics-informed neural networks (PiNNs), and (iii) physics-encoded neural networks (PeNNs). These methods provide distinct advantages for accelerating the numerical modeling of complex multiscale multi-physics phenomena. In addition, the recent developments in neural operators (NOs) add another dimension to these new simulation paradigms, especially when the real-time prediction of complex multi-physics systems is required. All these models also come with their own unique drawbacks and limitations that call for further fundamental research. This study aims to present a review of the four neural network frameworks (i.e., PgNNs, PiNNs, PeNNs, and NOs) used in scientific computing research. The state-of-the-art architectures and their applications are reviewed, limitations are discussed, and future research opportunities in terms of improving algorithms, considering causalities, expanding applications, and coupling scientific and deep learning solvers are presented. This critical review provides researchers and engineers with a solid starting point to comprehend how to integrate different layers of physics into neural networks.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. It can unravel hidden patterns within large data sets and reveal unparalleled insights, revolutionizing many industries and disciplines. However, machine and deep learning models lack interpretability and limited domain-specific knowledge, especially in applications such as physics and engineering. Alternatively, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) techniques integrate physics principles into data-driven models. By combining deep learning with domain knowledge, PIML improves the generalization of the model, abidance by the governing physical laws, and interpretability. This paper comprehensively reviews PIML applications related to subsurface energy systems, mainly in the oil and gas industry. The review highlights the successful utilization of PIML for tasks such as seismic applications, reservoir simulation, hydrocarbons production forecasting, and intelligent decision-making in the exploration and production stages. Additionally, it demonstrates PIML's capabilities to revolutionize the oil and gas industry and other emerging areas of interest, such as carbon and hydrogen storage; and geothermal systems by providing more accurate and reliable predictions for resource management and operational efficiency.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has been immensely successful at a variety of tasks, ranging from classification to artificial intelligence. Learning corresponds to fitting training data, which is implemented by descending a very high-dimensional loss function. Understanding under which conditions neural networks do not get stuck in poor minima of the loss, and how the landscape of that loss evolves as depth is increased, remains a challenge. Here we predict, and test empirically, an analogy between this landscape and the energy landscape of repulsive ellipses. We argue that in fully connected deep networks a phase transition delimits the over- and underparametrized regimes where fitting can or cannot be achieved. In the vicinity of this transition, properties of the curvature of the minima of the loss (the spectrum of the Hessian) are critical. This transition shares direct similarities with the jamming transition by which particles form a disordered solid as the density is increased, which also occurs in certain classes of computational optimization and learning problems such as the perceptron. Our analysis gives a simple explanation as to why poor minima of the loss cannot be encountered in the overparametrized regime. Interestingly, we observe that the ability of fully connected networks to fit random data is independent of their depth, an independence that appears to also hold for real data. We also study a quantity Δ which characterizes how well (Δ{\textless}0) or badly (Δ{\textgreater}0) a datum is learned. At the critical point it is power-law distributed on several decades, P+(Δ)∼Δθ for Δ{\textgreater}0 and P−(Δ)∼(−Δ)−γ for Δ{\textless}0, with exponents that depend on the choice of activation function. This observation suggests that near the transition the loss landscape has a hierarchical structure and that the learning dynamics is prone to avalanche-like dynamics, with abrupt changes in the set of patterns that are learned.},

	abstract = {We argue that in fully-connected networks a phase transition delimits the over- and under-parametrized regimes where fitting can or cannot be achieved. Under some general conditions, we show that this transition is sharp for the hinge loss. In the whole over-parametrized regime, poor minima of the loss are not encountered during training since the number of constraints to satisfy is too small to hamper minimization. Our findings support a link between this transition and the generalization properties of the network: as we increase the number of parameters of a given model, starting from an under-parametrized network, we observe that the generalization error displays three phases: (i) initial decay, (ii) increase until the transition point --- where it displays a cusp --- and (iii) slow decay toward a constant for the rest of the over-parametrized regime. Thereby we identify the region where the classical phenomenon of over-fitting takes place, and the region where the model keeps improving, in line with previous empirical observations for modern neural networks.},

The first neural operator was the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), proposed in 2019 based on rigorous approximation theory. Since then, a few other less general operators have been published, e.g., based on graph neural networks or Fourier transforms. For black box systems, training of neural operators is data-driven only but if the governing equations are known they can be incorporated into the loss function during training to develop physics-informed neural operators. Neural operators can be used as surrogates in design problems, uncertainty quantification, autonomous systems, and almost in any application requiring real-time inference. Moreover, independently pre-trained DeepONets can be used as components of a complex multi-physics system by coupling them together with relatively light training. Here, we present a review of DeepONet, the Fourier neural operator, and the graph neural operator, as well as appropriate extensions with feature expansions, and highlight their usefulness in diverse applications in computational mechanics, including porous media, fluid mechanics, and solid mechanics.},

Here, we report a method and preliminary data that simulates both tensile fracture and fluid flow at elevated pressures. To achieve this we developed a sample assembly consisting of a cylindrical core drilled with an axial borehole encapsulated in a 3D printed jacket permitting fluid from the borehole to move through the freshly generated tensile fracture to a voluometer. The permeability of Nash Point Shale increases from a pre-fracture value of 10−18 to 10−20 m2 (1 microDarcy, μD to 0.01 μD) to 2 × 10−15 m2 (2 milliDarcy, mD) immediately after fracture (at 2.1 MPa confining pressure). Permeability is strongly dependent on confining pressure, decreasing to 0.25 × 10−15 m2 (0.25 mD) at 19 MPa confining pressure (approximately 800 m depth), and does not recover when confinement is removed. Using concomitant measurements of the radial strain as a proxy for fracture aperture, we conclude that the effective permeability is governed solely by the width of the developed cracks, revealed by post-test X-Ray Computed Tomography to be planar, extending radially from the central conduit.},

	abstract = {In this work, we proposed a method for biohydrometallurgical processing of mining (old pyritic flotation tailings) and metallurgical (slag) wastes to recover gold and other nonferrous metals. Since this processing allows the removal of toxic metals or at least decreases their content in the solids, this approach may reduce the negative environmental impacts of such waste. The proposed process was based on pyritic tailings’ bioleaching to recover metals and produce leach liquor containing a strong oxidizing agent (ferric sulfate) to dissolve nonferrous metal from slag. This approach also allows us to increase concentrations of nonferrous metals in the pregnant leach solution after pyritic waste bioleaching to allow efficient extraction. The old pyritic tailings were previously leached with 0.25\% sulfuric acid for 10 min to remove soluble metal sulfates. As a result, 36\% of copper and 35\% of zinc were extracted. After 12 days of bioleaching with a microbial consortium containing Leptospirillum spp., Sulfobacillus spp., Ferroplasma spp., and Acidithiobacillus spp. at 35 °C, the total recovery of metals from pyritic tailings reached 68\% for copper and 77\% for zinc; and subsequent cyanidation allowed 92\% recovery of gold. Ferric leaching of two types of slag at 70 °C with the leachate obtained during bioleaching of the tailings and containing 15 g/L of Fe3+ allowed 88.9 and 43.4\% recovery of copper and zinc, respectively, from copper slag within 150 min. Meanwhile, 91.5\% of copper, 84.1\% of nickel, and 70.2\% of cobalt were extracted from copper–nickel slag within 120 min under the same conditions.},

	abstract = {Coupled modeling of subsurface multiphase fluid and heat flow, solute transport, and chemical reactions can be applied to many geologic systems and environmental problems, including geothermal systems, diagenetic and weathering processes, subsurface waste disposal, acid mine drainage remediation, contaminant transport, and groundwater quality. TOUGHREACT has been developed as a comprehensive non-isothermal multi-component reactive fluid flow and geochemical transport simulator to investigate these and other problems. A number of subsurface thermo-physical-chemical processes are considered under various thermohydrological and geochemical conditions of pressure, temperature, water saturation, and ionic strength. TOUGHREACT can be applied to one-, two- or three-dimensional porous and fractured media with physical and chemical heterogeneity. The code can accommodate any number of chemical species present in liquid, gas and solid phases. A variety of equilibrium chemical reactions are considered, such as aqueous complexation, gas dissolution/exsolution, and cation exchange. Mineral dissolution/precipitation can take place subject to either local equilibrium or kinetic controls, with coupling to changes in porosity and permeability and capillary pressure in unsaturated systems. Chemical components can also be treated by linear adsorption and radioactive decay. The first version of the non-isothermal reactive geochemical transport code TOUGHREACT was developed (Xu and Pruess, 1998) by introducing reactive geochemistry into the framework of the existing multi-phase fluid and heat flow code TOUGH2 (Pruess, 1991). TOUGHREACT was further enhanced with the addition of (1) treatment of mineral-water-gas reactive-transport under boiling conditions, (2) an improved HKF activity model for aqueous species, (3) gas species diffusion coefficients calculated as a function of pressure, temperature, and molecular properties, (4) mineral reactive surface area formulations for fractured and porous media, and (5) porosity, permeability, and capillary pressure changes owing to mineral precipitation/dissolution (Sonnenthal et al., 1998, 2000, 2001; Spycher et al., 2003a). Subsequently, TOUGH2 V2 was released with additional EOS modules and features (Pruess et al., 1999). The present version of TOUGHREACT includes all of the previous extensions to the original version, along with the replacement of the original TOUGH2 (Pruess, 1991) by TOUGH2 V2 (Pruess et al., 1999). TOUGHREACT has been applied to a wide variety of problems, some of which are included as examples, such as: (1) Supergene copper enrichment (Xu et al., 2001); (2) Mineral alteration in hydrothermal systems (Xu and Pruess, 2001a; Xu et al., 2004b; Dobson et al., 2004); (3) Mineral trapping for CO\{sub 2\} disposal in deep saline aquifers (Xu et al., 2003b and 2004a); (4) Coupled thermal, hydrological, and chemical processes in boiling unsaturated tuff for the proposed nuclear waste emplacement site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada (Sonnenthal et al., 1998, 2001; Sonnenthal and Spycher, 2000; Spycher et al., 2003a, b; Xu et al., 2001); (5) Modeling of mineral precipitation/dissolution in plug-flow and fracture-flow experiments under boiling conditions (Dobson et al., 2003); (6) Calcite precipitation in the vadose zone as a function of net infiltration (Xu et al., 2003); and (7) Stable isotope fractionation in unsaturated zone pore water and vapor (Singleton et al., 2004). The TOUGHREACT program makes use of 'self-documenting' features. It is distributed with a number of input data files for sample problems. Besides providing benchmarks for proper code installation, these can serve as a self-teaching tutorial in the use of TOUGHREACT, and they provide templates to help jump-start new applications. The fluid and heat flow part of TOUGHREACT is derived from TOUGH2 V2, so in addition to the current manual, users must have the manual of the TOUGH2 V2 (Pruess et al., 1999). The present version of TOUGHREACT provides the following TOUGH2 fluid property or 'EOS' (equation-of-state) modules: (1) EOS1 for water, or two waters with typical applications to hydrothermal problems, (2) EOS2 for multiphase mixtures of water and CO\{sub 2\} also with typical applications to hydrothermal problems, (3) EOS3 for multiphase mixtures of water and air with typical applications to vadose zone and nuclear waste disposal problems, (4) EOS4 that has the same capabilities as EOS3 but with vapor pressure lowering effects due to capillary pressure, (5) EOS9 for single phase water (Richards equation) with typical applications to ambient temperature and pressure reactive geochemical transport problems, and (6) ECO2N for multiphase mixtures of water, CO\{sub 2\} and NaCl with typical applications to CO\{sub 2\} disposal in deep brine aquifers.},

	abstract = {A physics informed neural network (PINN) incorporates the physics of a system by satisfying its boundary value problem through a neural network's loss function. The PINN approach has shown great success in approximating the map between the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) and its spatio-temporal input. However, for strongly non-linear and higher order partial differential equations PINN's accuracy reduces significantly. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel PINN scheme that solves the PDE sequentially over successive time segments using a single neural network. The key idea is to re-train the same neural network for solving the PDE over successive time segments while satisfying the already obtained solution for all previous time segments. Thus it is named as backward compatible PINN (bc-PINN). To illustrate the advantages of bc-PINN, we have used the Cahn Hilliard and Allen Cahn equations, which are widely used to describe phase separation and reaction diffusion systems. Our results show significant improvement in accuracy over the PINN method while using a smaller number of collocation points. Additionally, we have shown that using the phase space technique for a higher order PDE could further improve the accuracy and efficiency of the bc-PINN scheme.},

Unlike cPINN, XPINN can be extended to any type of PDEs. Moreover, the domain can be decomposed in any arbitrary way (in space and time), which is not possible in cPINN. Thus, XPINN offers both space and time parallelization, thereby reducing the training cost more effectively. In each subdomain, a separate neural network is employed with optimally selected hyperparame-ters, e.g., depth/width of the network, number and location of residual points, activation function, optimization method, etc. A deep network can be employed in a subdomain with complex solution, whereas a shallow neural network can be used in a subdomain with relatively simple and smooth so- lutions. We demonstrate the versatility of XPINN by solving both forward and inverse PDE problems, ranging from one-dimensional to three-dimensional problems, from time-dependent to time-independent problems, and from continu- ous to discontinuous problems, which clearly shows that the XPINN method is promising in many practical problems. The proposed XPINN method is the generalization of PINN and cPINN approaches, both in terms of applicability as well as domain decomposition approach, which efﬁciently lends itself to parallelized computation.

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in a variety of domains. While previous research in PINNs has mainly focused on constructing and balancing loss functions during training to avoid poor minima, the effect of sampling collocation points on the performance of PINNs has largely been overlooked. In this work, we find that the performance of PINNs can vary significantly with different sampling strategies, and using a fixed set of collocation points can be quite detrimental to the convergence of PINNs to the correct solution. In particular, (1) we hypothesize that training of PINNs rely on successful "propagation" of solution from initial and/or boundary condition points to interior points, and PINNs with poor sampling strategies can get stuck at trivial solutions if there are {\textbackslash}textit\{propagation failures\}. (2) We demonstrate that propagation failures are characterized by highly imbalanced PDE residual fields where very high residuals are observed over very narrow regions. (3) To mitigate propagation failure, we propose a novel {\textbackslash}textit\{evolutionary sampling\} (Evo) method that can incrementally accumulate collocation points in regions of high PDE residuals. We further provide an extension of Evo to respect the principle of causality while solving time-dependent PDEs. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed methods in a variety of PDE problems.},

The thermal–hydraulic coupled modeling was performed with the FE-software OpenGeoSys and COMSOL. For this purpose, the geological model was converted into a numerical model and calibrated by local and regional, hydrogeological and geothermal measured values. A detailed study based on two-phase storage-heating cycles per year with constant injection temperature on the ‘hot side’ of the ATES, different volumetric flow rates, and temperature spreads was performed to quantify possible storage capacities, energies, and efficiencies. The calculated efficiency of the cyclic storage operation in this study, averaged over 10 storage heating cycles, are between 50 and 85\%, depending on flow rate and temperature spread. The efficiency of the individual storage heating cycles increases from year to year in all scenarios considered, as the ‘hot side’ of the storage heats up in the long term. To increase ATES’ efficiency, also horizontal wells were integrated into the numerical model and the results were compared with those of inclined wells.},

In this paper, we focus on using the deep neural network to design an automatic numerical solver for the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations by proposing an improved physics informed neural network (PINN). Though the PINN has been embraced to investigate many differential equation problems, we find a direct application of the PINN in solving phase-field equations won't provide accurate solutions in many cases. Thus, we propose various techniques that add to the approximation power of the PINN. As a major contribution of this paper, we propose to embrace the adaptive idea in both space and time and introduce various sampling strategies, such that we are able to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the PINN on solving phase field equations. In addition, the improved PINN has no restriction on the explicit form of the PDEs, making it applicable to a wider class of PDE problems, and shedding light on numerical approximations of other PDEs in general.},

In recent years machine learning tools are aspiring to introduce new effective ways of simulating such equations, however existing approaches are not able to reliably return stable and accurate predictions across long temporal horizons. We aim to address this challenge by introducing an effective framework for learning evolution operators that map random initial conditions to associated ODE/PDE solutions within a short time interval. Such operators can be parametrized by deep neural networks that are trained in an entirely self-supervised manner without requiring one to generate any paired input-output observations. Global long-time predictions across a range of initial conditions can be then obtained by iteratively evaluating the trained model using each prediction as the initial condition for the next evaluation step. This introduces a new approach to temporal domain decomposition that is shown to be effective in performing accurate long-time simulations for a wide range of parametric ODE and PDE systems, from wave propagation, to reaction-diffusion dynamics and stiff chemical kinetics, introducing a new way of rapidly emulating non-equilibrium processes in science and engineering.},

Moreover, the co-existence of Ni2+ could largely enhance the H2 production kinetics. With the addition of only 1 \% Ni2+, the H2 production rate was remarkably enhanced by about two orders of magnitude at 90 °C. D2O isotopic experiment and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced H2 production kinetics could be attributed to the catalytic role of Ni2+ to promote the reduction of H2O.},

	abstract = {Serpentinites are an important component of the oceanic crust generated in slow to ultraslow spreading settings. In this context, the MOHO likely corresponds to a hydration boundary, which could match the 500°C isotherm beneath the ridge axis. Textures from serpentinites sampled in ridge environments demonstrate that most of the serpentinization occurs under static conditions. The typical mineralogical association consists of lizardite ± chrysotile + magnetite ± tremolite ± talc. Despite the widespread occurrence of lizardite, considered as the low temperature serpentine variety, oxygen isotope fractionation suggests that serpentinization starts at high temperature, in the range of 300–500°C. The fluid responsible for serpentinization is seawater, possibly evolved by interaction with the crust. Compared with fresh peridotites, serpentinites are strongly hydrated (10–15\% H2O) and oxidized. Serpentinization, however, does not seem to be accompanied by massive leaching of major elements, implying that it requires a volume increase. It results in an increase in chlorine, boron, fluorine, and sulfur, but its effect on other trace elements remains poorly detailed. The presence of serpentinites in the oceanic crust affects its physical properties, in particular by lowering its density and seismic velocities, and modifying its magnetic and rheological properties. Serpentinization may activate hydrothermal cells and generate methane and hydrogen anomalies which can sustain microbial communities. Two types of hydrothermal field have been identified: the Rainbow type, with high temperature (360°C) black smokers requiring magmatic heat; the low temperature (40–75°C) Lost City type, by contrast, can be activated by serpenintization reactions.

Résumé
Les serpentinites représentent un constituant important de la croûte océanique formée aux dorsales lentes et ultralentes. Dans ce contexte, le MOHO pourrait correspondre à un front d'hydratation et éventuellement à l'isotherme 500°C sous l'axe. L'observation des textures des serpentinites échantillonnées aux dorsales montre que l'essentiel de la serpentinisation a lieu en régime statique. L'association minérale type comprend lizardite ± chrysotile + magnetite ± tremolite ± talc. Malgré la présence de lizardite considérée comme l'espèce serpentineuse de basse température, le fractionnement isotopique de l'oxygène montre que la serpentinisation commence à température élevée, de l'ordre de 300 à 500°C. Le fluide responsable de la serpentinisation est majoritairement l'eau de mer, qui a pu évoluer par réaction avec la croûte. Par rapport aux péridotites fraı̂ches, la serpentinisation se traduit par une hydratation massive et l'oxydation du fer. Elle ne semble pas être accompagnée d'échanges importants en éléments majeurs, ce qui implique qu'elle entraı̂ne une augmentation de volume. Elle s'accompagne d'un enrichissement en chlore, bore, fluor, soufre. Son effet sur les autres éléments en traces reste mal contraint. La présence de serpentinites dans la croûte océanique affecte ses propriétés physiques, en particulier en abaissant la densité et les vitesses de propagation des ondes sismiques, et en modifiant ses propriétés magnétiques et rhéologiques. La serpentinisation peut activer des cellules de convection hydrothermales et provoquer des anomalies de méthane et d'hydrogène, capables d'alimenter des communautés microbiennes. Deux types de champs hydrothermaux ont été mis en évidence : le type « Rainbow », à fumeurs noirs de haute temperature (360°C), nécessite un apport de chaleur magmatique ; le type « Lost City » de basse température (40–75°C) peut être activé par la seule réaction de serpentinisation.

	abstract = {Recent work in scientific machine learning has developed so-called physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The typical approach is to incorporate physical domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss function and use existing machine learning methodologies to train the model. We demonstrate that, while existing PINN methodologies can learn good models for relatively trivial problems, they can easily fail to learn relevant physical phenomena for even slightly more complex problems. In particular, we analyze several distinct situations of widespread physical interest, including learning differential equations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators. We provide evidence that the soft regularization in PINNs, which involves PDE-based differential operators, can introduce a number of subtle problems, including making the problem more ill-conditioned. Importantly, we show that these possible failure modes are not due to the lack of expressivity in the NN architecture, but that the PINN's setup makes the loss landscape very hard to optimize. We then describe two promising solutions to address these failure modes. The first approach is to use curriculum regularization, where the PINN's loss term starts from a simple PDE regularization, and becomes progressively more complex as the NN gets trained. The second approach is to pose the problem as a sequence-to-sequence learning task, rather than learning to predict the entire space-time at once. Extensive testing shows that we can achieve up to 1-2 orders of magnitude lower error with these methods as compared to regular PINN training.},

	abstract = {Suction bucket foundations are being used for a wide variety of offshore foundations. However, accurate modeling of its installation remains challenging due to the complexity of soil transportation, in which the soil is typically treated as a continuum and its discrete behavior is neglected. In this paper, the bucket foundation installation in the sand under different installation methods (i.e., jacked and suction-assisted installation) is investigated from a microscopic perspective (i.e., particle scale) based on the three-dimensional coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and coarse-grained discrete element method (CGDEM). It is found that the CFD-CGDEM method can successfully simulate the bucket installation process. Suction-assisted installation results in a significant reduction in the inner skirt friction resistance and end resistance, while the outer skirt friction resistance shows only a minor decrease. During suction-assisted installation, soil loosening inside the bucket contributes more significantly to the soil plug formation compared to the inflow of external soil. Compared to jacked installation, the seepage induces a significant reduction in the effective stress of soil within the interior and below the bucket tip, while it increases the effective stress outside slightly under suction-assisted installation. The work provides an alternative research approach for the suction bucket installation.},

The results allowed quantification of differences in the behaviour of caissons installed entirely by jacking compared with a combination of self-weight and suction as is used in the field. For jacked installation, over the penetration range of one to four diameters, the proportion of caisson wall accommodated by inward soil flow reduced from around 45\% at the start to zero at about four diameters embedment; by contrast, the proportion for suction installation stayed essentially constant, oscillating around 65\% through the depth of penetration. This difference was also evident in the local incremental displacements of the soil beneath the caisson tip. During continuous penetration, the induced increases in radial and mean total stresses around the caisson wall are some 10\%–15\% smaller for suction installation than for jacked installation, with the difference growing with increasing penetration. In addition, an obvious difference was found in the caisson tip resistance between these two installation methods.Key words: suction caisson, clay, large deformation finite element, soil plug, total stress changes, penetration resistance, factor of safety.},

	abstract = {The suction caisson (or called suction anchor) which is considered as a relatively new type of foundation of offshore structures, has been extensively studied and applied for offshore wind turbines and oil platforms. The installation of the suction caisson is of great importance in the design and construction because it can bring about several issues and further influence the performance of holding capacity in safety service. In this paper, large deformation finite element (FE) analyses are performed to model the installation of suction caisson (SC) by suction and jacking in normally consolidated clay. The penetration of the suction caisson is modeled using an axisymmetric FE approach with the help of the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) formulation which can satisfactorily solve the large deformation problem. The undrained shear strength of the clay and elastic modulus are varied with depth of soil through the subroutine VUFIELD. The numerical results allow quantification of the penetration resistance and its dependence on the installation method. The centrifuge test and theoretical solution are used for the FE model validation. After the validation, the penetration resistance, the soil plug heave, and the caisson wall friction have been examined through the FE model. Based on the numerical results, it is shown that the ALE technique can simulate the entire suction caisson penetration without mesh distortion problem. The installation method can play an important role on the penetration resistance, namely, the suction installation reduces the penetration resistance significantly compared to the purely jacked installation. With a further study on the suction case, it is found that as the final applied suction pressure increases, the soil plug heave increases, while the penetration resistance reduces with increase of the final suction pressure. The effect of the friction of internal caisson walls has been also investigated and a conclusion is drawn that internal wall friction has a significant contribution to the penetration resistance and it can be implicitly represented by varying coefficient of internal wall friction. As for the penetration resistance, both jacked and suction installation have great dependency on the internal wall friction.},

	abstract = {The concrete-made bucket foundations were employed as emerging solution to support the wind turbine or breakwater, where the relatively large thicknesses of skirts and the strain softening effect related to the soil sensitivity and ductility were necessary to be explicitly accounted for. However, few of current study concerned this topic. This paper therefore reported an extensive parametric investigation of penetrating behaviour for bucket foundation in nonhomogeneous clay to allow a better estimation of penetration resistance of bucket foundation. The three-dimensional (3D) large deformation finite element (LDFE) analysis model incorporating the effect of strain softening on soil strength was set up and validated by comparing to the published centrifuge data. Then the evolution of soil flow mechanism and the distribution of soil strength softening were examined with the soil plug generated inside skirt assessed. Based on the numerical results, a new analytical model was proposed to predict the penetration resistance of bucket foundation in clay accounting for a partially-remoulded condition.},

	abstract = {Bucket foundations, as an innovative type of offshore wind turbine foundation, have been widely adopted for their cost competitiveness and time effectiveness in construction and installation. For a successful installation, the penetration process prediction is crucial. This paper investigates the penetration process of both thin-walled and thick-walled bucket foundations in silty clay through small-scale experiments. Based on the experimental results, empirical formulas of penetration resistance are modified. Next, a Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) numerical method is validated and used to simulate the sinking process of engineering prototypes. The penetration resistance obtained by the calculated and numerical methods is in good agreement. Additionally, through the 3D CEL analysis, the disturbance of bulkheads and skirts on soil plugs is gained. The Eulerian volume fraction shows that the soil surface within the outer compartments is prone to rise to form a soil plug, which will bring out a sudden sharp increase in the penetration resistance due to the contact of lid and soil, and consequently affect the ultimate installation depth.},

	abstract = {Since concrete is cheaper and more resistant to corrosion than steel, the wide-shallow concrete bucket foundation is being used extensively in ocean engineering. By adding the inner bucket and cruciform skirts, both the bearing capacity and rigidity of the wide-shallow concrete bucket foundation increase significantly. When compared to the hollow steel bucket foundation, the inclusion of thicker skirts, as well as the addition of inner bucket and cruciform skirts, would cause changes to the soil flow mechanism, resulting in soil heave within each compartment and changes in soil strength evolution and penetration resistance during installation in clay. In order to study the influence of the addition of the inner bucket and cruciform skirts on the soil heaving inside each compartment, soil softening and penetration resistance, three-dimensional large deformation finite element (LDFE) models for the bucket foundation with and without inner bucket, and cruciform skirts considering soil remolding were established using the Coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian (CEL) approach. It was found that the inner bucket significantly changes the soil flow and softening of the soil during penetration of the bucket foundation. According to the theoretical analysis and numerical results, the diameter of the optimal inner bucket is equal to 5/8 of the outer diameter. The adhesion coefficient observed in this study falls within the range of 0.5 to 0.8, which is higher than the theoretical value of 0.25 that assumes the soil is fully remolded. The reason for this discrepancy is that the soil is only partially remolded during the actual installation of the bucket foundation. The neglect of the softening of the soil or considering the soil as completely softened will result in significant variation in the predicted penetration resistance; hence, partial softening of the soil should be taken into account.},

	abstract = {In offshore wind energy industry, the bucket foundation in clay has been considered as an alternative to conventional foundations due to their unique features such as high overturning resistance. However, it cannot be installed to the pre-determined depth due to the soil plug generated during the penetration, which will significantly affect its bearing capacity. By setting the external beveled tip at the bottom of the bucket, the height of the soil plug can be reduced effectively. In order to study the influence of external beveled tip on the soil plug, soil softening and penetration resistance, the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is used in this study to establish the bucket foundation penetration resistance models in correlation with different angles of external beveled tip considering soil large deformation and strain softening. It was found that as the angle increases, more soil are directed and flows out of the bucket, and the height of soil surface inside the bucket obviously decreases. When the angle increases to 60°, the soil plug inside the bucket is very small and hardly changes. As the angle increases from 0° to 60°, the degree of softening and amount of soil inside the bucket decreases, while that the trend is opposite for the soil outside the bucket. In addition, due to the influence of soil flow and strength degradation, the end bearing capacity factor and the frictional coefficient of inner side wall decrease as the angle increases, while the coefficient of outer side wall increases due to the reduction of softening effect. However, the total penetration resistance of the bucket foundation does not obviously change with the external beveled tip angle. 60° is recommended as the optimal angle for the external beveled tip in order to avoid the soil plug inside the bucket.},

	abstract = {Bucket foundations are increasingly used to support offshore wind turbines. Its bearing performance has been extensively investigated, but its installation process has been addressed in a few investigations. This study investigates the penetration resistance during the installation of bucket foundations in clay through finite element models that consider large soil deformations. The proper finite element modeling scheme is assessed first, then a validated numerical model is employed to investigate the effects of length-diameter ratio and soil properties on the soil plug and penetration resistance. The results indicate that a minimum element dimension and penetration velocity should be set to 1/6th of skirt thickness and 0.3 m/s to ensure a good balance between computational accuracy and efficiency. An increase in the bucket length-to-diameter ratio increases the height of soil heave, while soil nonuniformity reduces it. In addition, the height of soil heave is slightly influenced by the friction coefficient and undrained shear strength of the soil. On the other hand, the penetration resistance is strongly affected by the soil undrained shear strength and bucket length-diameter ratio, but slightly affected by the friction coefficient.},

Insights into the requirements of numerically stable and efficient implementations of the constitutive models are provided. Following its installation, the response of the pile to lateral loading is investigated and the numerical results are compared to results of model tests. Sanisand is found to be superior in terms of computational performance for the simulation of the pile installation but predicts the pile response to lateral loading following the installation process worse compared to the simulations using Hypoplasticity. The installation-induced changes in the soil state have less influence on the lateral pile response in case of the simulations using Sanisand. It is concluded that both constitutive models are suitable to study large-deformation pile installation processes but the results can differ significantly between the constitutive models despite a careful calibration of the material constants.},

	abstract = {The continuous increase in population and human migration to urban and coastal areas leads to the expansion of built environments over natural habitats. Current infrastructure suffers from environmental changes and their impact on ecosystem services. Foundations are static anchoring structures dependent on soil compaction, which reduces water infiltration and increases flooding. Coastal infrastructure reduces wave action and landward erosion but alters natural habitat and sediment transport. On the other hand, root systems are multifunctional, resilient, biological structures that offer promising strategies for the design of civil and coastal infrastructure, such as adaptivity, multifunctionality, self-healing, mechanical and chemical soil attachment. Therefore, the biomimetic methodology is employed to abstract root strategies of interest for the design of building foundations and coastal infrastructures that prevent soil erosion, anchor structures, penetrate soils, and provide natural habitat. The strategies are described in a literature review on root biology, then these principles are abstracted from their biological context to show their potential for engineering transfer. After a review of current and developing technologies in both application fields, the abstracted strategies are translated into conceptual designs for foundation and coastal engineering. In addition to presenting the potential of root-inspired designs for both fields, this paper also showcases the main steps of the biomimetic methodology from the study of a biological system to the development of conceptual technical designs. In this way the paper also contributes to the development of a more strategic intersection between biology and engineering and provides a framework for further research and development projects.},

These interactions are made possible by strategies that enable organisms to accomplish functions that can be analogous to those required in geotechnical engineering systems. Examples include anchorage in soft and weak ground, penetration into hard and stiff subsurface materials and movement in loose sand. Since the biological strategies have been ‘vetted’ by the process of natural selection, and the functions they accomplish are governed by the same physical laws in both the natural and engineered environments, they represent a unique source of principles and design ideas for addressing geotechnical challenges. Prior to implementation as engineering solutions, however, the differences in spatial and temporal scales and material properties between the biological environment and engineered system must be addressed. Current bio-inspired geotechnics research is addressing topics such as soil excavation and penetration, soil–structure interface shearing, load transfer between foundation and anchorage elements and soils, and mass and thermal transport, having gained inspiration from organisms such as worms, clams, ants, termites, fish, snakes and plant roots. This work highlights the potential benefits to both geotechnical engineering through new or improved solutions and biology through understanding of mechanisms as a result of cross-disciplinary interactions and collaborations.},

The associated foundations or anchors may encounter a range of seafloor sediment types and geotechnical properties. Wave and tidal energy convertors induce unique loads on foundations and anchors that are different from other seafloor engineering applications. Thus, there is a need for a combination of advanced site analysis and performance assessment. Geotechnical engineering plays the vital role of ensuring that foundation and anchor systems perform successfully for MRE devices. Our paper reviews the unique frequency and magnitude of loading regimes experienced by MRE arrays. We examine potential loading conditions on the foundation-anchor systems. Loading regimes include environmental and system loads from single devices or arrays of devices. We present specific load examples from field data. We explore the applicable geotechnical approaches to address these conditions, including constitutive models that may or may not adequately capture the response of the seafloor sediments to the MRE loads. Partially to fully dynamic constitutive model formulations may be necessary to properly model sediment-fluid hydromechanical response to MRE loading. Spacing of full MRE arrays and spatial variability in sediment properties may require multiple foundation types.},

A MCED utilises the kinetic energy of the tides as opposed to the potential energy which is utilised by a tidal barrage. Over the past decade MCEDs have become an increasingly popular method of energy extraction. However, marine current energy technology is still not economically viable on a large scale due to its current stage of development.

	abstract = {Natural geologic hydrogen (H2) could supply climate-friendly energy. We perform a prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) of a generic natural H2 production and processing system, using engineering physics and chemistry to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity. Our baseline case gas contains 85 mol \% H2, 12\% N2, and 1.5\% CH4. Well productivity, depth, and other parameters use data from US natural gas wells. We use an open-source LCA tool to model energy use and emissions. Site-boundary baseline GHG intensity is ∼0.4 kg CO2 equiv/kg H2 or ∼3 g CO2 equiv/MJ lower heating value (LHV) H2. The largest sources of GHGs are fugitive emissions and embodied emissions. Sensitivity analysis is performed by examining varying gas compositions, reservoir parameters, and production methods. Results are sensitive to CH4 content: a case with 75\% H2 and 22.5\% CH4 emits 1.5 kg CO2 equiv/kg H2. Other key drivers include sources of process energy and the handling and disposing of waste (non-H2) species.},

	abstract = {The kinetics of the reaction (Mg,Fe)-olivine + H2O → serpentine + magnetite + brucite + H2 were investigated at 500 bars in the 250–350°C range using natural olivine (San Carlos; Fo91) with grain sizes between 1 and 150 μm and for run durations up to 514 d. The amount of magnetite produced, which directly relates to reaction progress, was accurately monitored using up to 24 time-resolved magnetic measurements per experiment. Eighty percent of serpentinization was achieved after 60 d for olivine grain sizes of 5–15μm and after 500 d for grain sizes of 50–63 μm. Serpentinization kinetics were found to be inversely proportional to the geometrical surface area of the starting olivine grains. They were one or two orders of magnitude slower than serpentinization kinetics commonly used for modeling serpentinization-related processes. The nature of the serpentine mineral product depended on the initial olivine grain size (IGS); for IGS in the 5–150μm range lizardite formed, and olivine dissolution was the rate-limiting process. At IGS below 5μm, chrysotile crystallized instead of lizardite, and the relationship between olivine surface area and reaction kinetics no longer held. We infer that for such small olivine grain sizes dissolution is no longer the rate-limiting process. Serpentinization in our experiments was associated with the creation of new reactive surface area according to two cooperative processes: etch pits formation associated with dissolution and grain fracturing for IGS above 20μm. Interestingly, fractures and etch pits with similar geometry and sizes were also observed for residual olivine (with a typical grain size of 50 μm) in serpentinized peridotite samples from the Southwest Indian Ridge. This suggests that the processes governing olivine serpentinization kinetics in our experiments are similar to those prevailing in natural systems. We therefore suggest that the new kinetic data set that we present here, which encompasses a range of olivine grain sizes and reaction temperatures, is relevant to the serpentinization of olivine in the oceanic crust insofar as water is available.},

This article reviews the geology of the MBO region, summarizes recent research, and provides new data constraining ongoing alteration. Host rocks are partially to completely serpentinized, residual mantle harzburgites, and replacive. Dunites show evidence for “reactive fractionation,” in which cooling, crystallizing magmas reacted with older residues of melting. Harzburgites and dunites are 65\%–100\% hydrated. Ferric to total iron ratios vary from 50\% to 90\%. In Hole BA1B, alteration extent decreases with depth. Gradients in water and core composition are correlated. Serpentine veins are intergrown with, and cut, carbonate veins with measurable 14C. Ongoing hydration is accompanied by SiO2 addition. Sulfur enrichment in Hole BA1B may result from oxidative leaching of sulfur from the upper 30 m, coupled with sulfate reduction and sulfide precipitation at 30–150 m. Oxygen fugacity deep in Holes BA3A, NSHQ14, and BA2A is fixed by the reaction 2H2O = 2H2 + O2 combined with oxidation of ferrous iron in serpentine, brucite, and olivine. fO2 deep in Holes BA1A, BA1D, and BA4A is 3–4 log units above the H2O-H2 limit, controlled by equilibria involving serpentine and brucite. Variations in alteration are correlated with texture, with reduced, low SiO2 assemblages in mesh cores recording very low water/rock ratios, juxtaposed with adjacent veins recording much higher ratios. The proportion of reduced mesh cores versus oxidized veins increases with depth, and the difference in fO2 recorded in cores and veins decreases with depth.},

	abstract = {Serpentinization of ultramafic rocks is widely recognized as a source of molecular hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) to support microbial activity, but the extent and rates of formation of these compounds in low-temperature, near-surface environments are poorly understood. Laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the production of H2 and CH4 during low-temperature reaction of water with ultramafic rocks and minerals. Experiments were performed by heating olivine or harzburgite with aqueous solutions at 90°C for up to 213 days in glass bottles sealed with butyl rubber stoppers. Although H2 and CH4 increased steadily throughout the experiments, the levels were very similar to those found in mineral-free controls, indicating that the rubber stoppers were the predominant source of these compounds. Levels of H2 above background were observed only during the first few days of reaction of harzburgite when CO2 was added to the headspace, with no detectable production of H2 or CH4 above background during further heating of the harzburgite or in experiments with other mineral reactants. Consequently, our results indicate that production of H2 and CH4 during low-temperature alteration of ultramafic rocks may be much more limited than some recent experimental studies have suggested. We also found no evidence to support a recent report suggesting that spinels in ultramafic rocks may stimulate H2 production. While secondary silicates were observed to precipitate during the experiments, formation of these deposits was dominated by Si released by dissolution of the glass bottles, and reaction of the primary silicate minerals appeared to be very limited. While use of glass bottles and rubber stoppers has become commonplace in experiments intended to study processes that occur during serpentinization of ultramafic rocks at low temperatures, the high levels of H2, CH4, and SiO2 released during heating indicate that these reactor materials are unsuitable for this purpose.

	abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to examine how partitioning of Fe among solid reaction products and rates of H2 generation vary as a function of temperature during serpentinization of olivine. Individual experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 200 to 320°C, with reaction times spanning a few days to over a year. The extent of reaction ranged from {\textless}1\% to ∼23\%. Inferred rates for serpentinization of olivine during the experiments were 50–80 times slower than older studies had reported but are consistent with more recent results, indicating that serpentinization may proceed more slowly than previously thought. Reaction products were dominated by chrysotile, brucite, and magnetite, with minor amounts of magnesite, dolomite, and iowaite. The chrysotile contained only small amounts of Fe (XFe=0.03–0.05, with ∼25\% present as ferric Fe in octahedral sites), and displayed little variation in composition with reaction temperature. Conversely, the Fe contents of brucite (XFe=0.01–0.09) increased steadily with decreasing reaction temperature. Analysis of the reaction products indicated that the stoichiometry of the serpentinization reactions varied with temperature, but remained constant with increasing reaction progress at a given temperature. The observed distribution of Fe among the reaction products does not appear to be entirely consistent with existing equilibrium models of Fe partitioning during serpentinization, suggesting improved models that include kinetic factors or multiple reaction steps need to be developed. Rates of H2 generation increased steeply from 200 to 300°C, but dropped off at higher temperatures. This trend in H2 generation rates is attributable to a combination of the overall rate of serpentinization reactions and increased partitioning of Fe into brucite rather than magnetite at lower temperatures. The results suggest that millimolal concentration of H2 could be attained in moderately hot hydrothermal systems like Lost City during fluid circulation on timescales of a few years.},

	abstract = {Fluids circulating through actively serpentinizing systems are often highly enriched in methane (CH4). In many cases, the CH4 in these fluids is thought to derive from abiotic reduction of inorganic carbon, but the conditions under which this process can occur in natural systems remain unclear. In recent years, several studies have reported abiotic formation of CH4 during experimental serpentinization of olivine at temperatures at or below 200 °C. However, these results seem to contradict studies conducted at higher temperatures (300 °C to 400 °C), where substantial kinetic barriers to CH4 synthesis have been observed. Here, the potential for abiotic formation of CH4 from dissolved inorganic carbon during olivine serpentinization is reevaluated in a series of laboratory experiments conducted at 200 °C to 320 °C. A 13C-labeled inorganic carbon source was used to unambiguously determine the origin of CH4 generated in the experiments. Consistent with previous high-temperature studies, the results indicate that abiotic formation of CH4 from reduction of dissolved inorganic carbon during the experiments is extremely limited, with nearly all of the observed CH4 derived from background sources. The results indicate that the potential for abiotic synthesis of CH4 in low-temperature serpentinizing environments may be much more limited than some recent studies have suggested. However, more extensive production of CH4 was observed in one experiment performed under conditions that allowed an H2-rich vapor phase to form, suggesting that shallow serpentinization environments where a separate gas phase is present may be more favorable for abiotic synthesis of CH4.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new fully-coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation for unsaturated soils is developed to study the influence of rainfall infiltration on slope stability. The single-layer two-phase formulation is investigated in SPH for the first time to simulate the response of unsaturated soils. The use of a single set of particles improves the computational efficiency and facilitates the implementation of infiltration boundary conditions. The Drucker–Prager strain-softening model, with the use of Bishop's effective stress, is adopted as the soil’s constitutive model. New extensions of a first-order consistent wall boundary treatment are proposed for the coupled hydro-mechanical problem to enforce non-slip/free-slip conditions for the soil phase and water phase. A novel stress diffusion algorithm for general application is introduced to smooth out the numerical noise in the stress field under large deformation. The accuracy of the formulated SPH model is examined with available analytical solutions and experimental data. The proposed numerical scheme is finally applied to the simulation of rainfall-induced slope collapse of an unsaturated slope with two different bedrock geometries. Results demonstrate that the geometry of the bedrock is shown to play an important role in the failure initiation and propagation of the collapse. It is found that the proposed model allows the investigation of both triggering and post-failure mechanism, providing a smooth stress field even at large deformations.},

	abstract = {Tailings generated during processing of sulfide ores represent a substantial risk to water resources. The oxidation of sulfide minerals within tailings deposits can generate low-quality water containing elevated concentrations of SO4, Fe, and associated metal(loid)s. Acid generated during the oxidation of pyrite [FeS2], pyrrhotite [Fe(1−x)S] and other sulfide minerals is neutralized to varying degrees by the dissolution of carbonate, (oxy)hydroxide, and silicate minerals. The extent of acid neutralization and, therefore, pore-water pH is a principal control on the mobility of sulfide-oxidation products within tailings deposits. Metals including Fe(III), Cu, Zn, and Ni often occur at high concentrations and exhibit greater mobility at low pH characteristic of acid mine drainage (AMD). In contrast, (hydr)oxyanion-forming elements including As, Sb, Se, and Mo commonly exhibit greater mobility at circumneutral pH associated with neutral mine drainage (NMD). These differences in mobility largely result from the pH-dependence of mineral precipitation–dissolution and sorption–desorption reactions. Cemented layers of secondary (oxy)hydroxide and (hydroxy)sulfate minerals, referred to as hardpans, may promote attenuation of sulfide-mineral oxidation products within and below the oxidation zone. Hardpans may also limit oxygen ingress and pore-water migration within sulfide tailings deposits. Reduction–oxidation (redox) processes are another important control on metal(loid) mobility within sulfide tailings deposits. Reductive dissolution or transformation of secondary (oxy)hydroxide phases can enhance Fe, Mn, and As mobility within sulfide tailings. Production of H2S via microbial sulfate reduction may promote attenuation of sulfide-oxidation products, including Fe, Zn, Ni, and Tl, via metal-sulfide precipitation. Understanding the dynamics of these interrelated geochemical and mineralogical processes is critical for anticipating and managing water quality associated with sulfide mine tailings.},

	abstract = {Hydrothermal alteration batch experiments were conducted on olivine bearing mine tailings in order to investigate two potential valorization methods: the ex-situ CO2 sequestration and hydrogen production. The originality of this work lies in the simultaneous investigation of these two processes. We reacted powdered mine tailings with CO2-saturated water at three different sets of P/T conditions, 473 K/15 MPa, 523 K/30 MPa and 573 K/30 MPa. After 25 days of reaction, CO2 was sequestered in the form of Fe-bearing magnesite, (Mg,Fe)CO3 in all the experiments. Maximum carbonation yield was achieved at 523 K and 30 MPa, which was 53.8 wt.\% of product, equivalent to the trapping of 320.5 g of CO2 per kg of mine tailings. Hydrogen gas was produced via the oxidation of Fe2+ in olivine. The highest quantity of hydrogen (H2) was produced at 573 K/30 MPa which was 0.57 g of H2 per kg of mine tailings. It suggests that the temperatures between 523 K and 540 K at pCO2 = 30 MPa are favorable for simultaneous ex-situ CO2 mineral sequestration and hydrogen production from New Caledonian mine tailings. The combined method of ex-situ CO2 storage and hydrogen production proposed by this study offsets 90\% of New Caledonia's annual CO2 emissions while compensating ∼10\% of New Caledonia's annual energy demand. More globally, it has implications for cost effective disposal of industrial CO2 emissions and production of hydrogen gas (clean energy) at a large scale; those two processes could be combined using the residual heat provided by a third one such as the high temperature smelting of ore.},

Characterization of minerals, especially sulphide and carbonate phases, is particularly important for predicting the potential for acidic drainage and metal(loid) leaching. Another valuable outcome from mineralogical studies of mine waste is an understanding of the stability of reactive and metal(loid)-bearing minerals under various redox conditions. This paper reviews analytical methods that have been used to study mine waste mineralogy, including conventional methods such as X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, and advanced methods such as synchrotron-based microanalysis and automated mineralogy. We recommend direct collaboration between researchers and mining companies to choose the optimal mineralogical techniques to solve complex problems, to co-publish the results, and to ensure that mineralogical knowledge is used to inform mine waste management at all stages of the mining life cycle. A case study of arsenic-bearing gold mine tailings from Nova Scotia is presented to demonstrate the application of mineralogical techniques to improve human health risk assessment and the long-term management of historical mine wastes.},

Whereas after 65 h, H2 yield was negligible in pure water at 423 K, the reaction 3 FeO(s) + H2O(l) → Fe3O4(s) + H2(aq) reached near completion at the same temperature within 10 h in a solution containing 0.05 mol/l acetic acid. Increasing acetic acid concentration by one order of magnitude did not yield significantly more H2. At identical initial pH, acetic acid was found to be more efficient than oxalic acid and hydrochloric acid at enhancing H2 production. Acidic conditions increased FeO dissolution kinetics and, consequently, improved H2 yield. The specific efficiency of acetic acid resides in its thermal stability as well as in the potential of ligand-promoted Fe(II) dissolution. We show that the positive kinetics effect of mild acetic acid solutions over H2 yield evidenced on FeO does not apply directly to steel slags which buffer the pH to high values due to the presence of large amounts of CaO.},

In this study, chemical oxidation technology was applied to establish a 12 m3/d pilot-scale treatment process to precipitate high-concentration iron (510.3 ± 50 mg/L) under acidic conditions. The experimental results showed that the Fe2+ oxidation rate and TFe (total Fe) removal rate exceeded 99\%, while the loss of Cu and Mn did not exceed 4\%. The average Fe content of the recovered sludge was 26.85\%, which signifies good recycling value. In addition, an economic analysis showed that this method was 14 cents cheaper per m3 than the traditional lime neutralization method for treating AMD, which would result in large annual savings for sludge treatment costs.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a numerical simulation for exploring the characteristics of soils and porewater pressure development during the suction bucket installation in the sand. The dynamic-mesh technology and new drag force model considering irregular particle shapes are adopted in the CFD-DEM model. By comparing the results of experimental and theoretical models, the validation of the numerical program has been proved. Then, this study is motivated by the fact that marine sediments generally exhibit a porosity decreasing with depth because of consolidation under gravity. Results demonstrate that the seabed face porosity is the critical factor that causes differences in penetration resistance and porewater pressure distribution at late installation stages. Additionally, penetration mechanisms with different depths are analyzed by particle migration, porewater pressure distribution, and flow field. Based on microscopic analysis, apart from seepage would induce a noticeable migration of fine particles, the apparent soil-squeezing effect is another essential factor to cause soil displacement and expansion in dense sand. Finally, the bucket can be safely installed in sand, despite the permeability coefficient inside the bucket reaching the critical state. Such a macro and micro insight will further facilitate the design of suction bucket installation, particularly considering the influence of sand permeability.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a computational framework based on the mesh-free smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is developed to study the coupled behaviour of fluid and solid in a deformable porous medium. The mathematical framework developed herein is derived from the Biot's two-phase mixture theory in which the solid is modelled as an elasto-plastic material and the pore-fluid as an incompressible fluid. The key feature of the proposed numerical framework is that both solid and fluid phases are solved simultaneously in two different Lagrangian discretisations (or two different sets of Lagrangian particles) using their own governing equations that are linked through several laws of physics. The capability of the SPH method to model large deformation of the solid materials enables the framework to account for the permeability change due to the dilatant shear behaviour of the solid phase. To obtain a stable and accurate SPH solution for the pore-fluid, an incompressible SPH (ISPH) approach is adapted to correctly simulate the pore-pressure distribution of the fluid phase inside the porous medium. The proposed coupled SPH framework is firstly validated against analytical and solutions obtained using finite element method (FEM) for a submerged soil medium subjected to a gravitational load and a seepage flow through an elastic embankment, respectively. Then, it is employed for the simulation of flows through rockfill dams and an embankment failure induced by seepage flows. Simulation results predicted by SPH show very good agreements with analytical, FEM and experimental results. This suggests that the proposed two-phase SPH framework is a promising approach for future studies of coupled problems that involve complex water free-surface/seepage flows and large deformation of soils which are difficult to be modelled using traditional FEM-based coupled two-phase flow models.},

	abstract = {The method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has recently been applied to computational geomechanics and has been shown to be a powerful alternative to the standard numerical method, that is, the finite element method, for handling large deformation and post-failure of geomaterials. However, very few studies apply the SPH method to model saturated or submerged soil problems. Our recent studies of this matter revealed that significant errors may be made if the gradient of the pore-water pressure is handled using the standard SPH formulation. To overcome this problem and to enhance the SPH applications to computational geomechanics, this article proposes a general SPH formulation, which can be applied straightforwardly to dry and saturated soils. For simplicity, the current work assumes hydrostatic pore-water pressure. It is shown that the proposed formulation can remove the numerical error mentioned earlier. Moreover, this formulation automatically satisfies the dynamic boundary conditions at a submerged ground surface, thereby saving computational cost. Discussions on the applications of the standard and new SPH formulations are also given through some numerical tests. Furthermore, techniques to obtain the correct SPH solution are also proposed and discussed throughout. As an application of the proposed method, the effect of the dilatancy angle on the failure mechanism of a two-sided embankment subjected to a high groundwater table is presented and compared with that of other solutions. Finally, the proposed formulation can be considered a basic formulation for further developments of SPH for saturated soils. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this calculation, water is modeled as a viscous fluid with week compressibility and soil is modeled as an elastic–perfectly plastic material. The Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion is applied to describe the stress states of soil in the plastic flow regime. Dry soil is modeled by one-phase flow while saturated soil is modeled by separate water and soil phases. Interaction between soil and water is taken into account by means of pore water pressure and seepage force. Simulation tests of soil excavation by a water jet are calculated as a challenging example to verify the broad applicability of the SPH method. The excavations are carried out in two different soil models, one is dry soil and the other is fully saturated soil. Numerical results obtained in this paper have shown that the gross discontinuities of soil failure can be simulated without any difficulties. This supports the feasibility and attractiveness of this a new approach in geomechanics applications.

	abstract = {Seepage-induced internal erosion and failure in unsaturated/saturated porous media is challenging for computational simulations as they involve the behaviour, interactions (solid, air, water) and transformation (fluidisation and deposition of fines grains) of different phases. Tackling this challenging problem requires correct mathematical descriptions of phase interactions and transformation together with a robust computational framework, both of which are addressed in this paper. The new mathematical model and coupled governing equations based on the continuum mixture theory enable the use of a single set of SPH particles for the descriptions of behaviour, interactions and phase transformation of all five phases of the porous media (soil skeleton, erodible fines particles, fluidised particles, water, and air), including the effect of both saturation and erosion on the shear strength of porous media. A fully explicit and stabilised SPH framework that allows accurate SPH approximations of spatial gradients is proposed for the numerical solutions of coupled governing equations. The proposed computational framework performs well in benchmark tests against available analytical and numerical solutions and achieved reasonable agreements with experiments. Numerical results obtained from the predictions of seepage-induced erosion and failure demonstrate that the proposed computational framework is efficient for addressing challenging problems involving coupled flow-deformation, seepage-induced internal erosions, and large deformation failures of unsaturated/saturated porous media.},

	abstract = {Particle-based methods such as SPH have been proven to be powerful numerical tools for addressing challenges in solving coupled large deformation and failure of porous materials. In these applications, explicit time integration schemes are commonly adopted to integrate the coupled pore-water pressure equation. The Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition is required and imposes a strong restriction on the time increment, which is inversely proportional to the water bulk modulus, leading to a significant increase in the overall computational costs. This affects successful applications of SPH in solving field-scale fully coupled large deformation and failure of porous media. To address this problem, this study proposes a computationally efficient three-point integration (TPI) scheme that removes the influence of water bulk modulus from the pore-water pressure equation, enabling larger time increments for the time integration and hence saving computational costs for field-scale applications. Furthermore, a stabilised method is proposed to enable SPH to solve coupled flow-deformation of saturated porous media involving negative excess pore-water developments for the first time. The proposed SPH algorithm is verified against analytical and finite element solutions for small deformation ranges. Thereafter, it is applied to predict challenging problems involving large deformation and retrogressive failure of saturated porous materials, where contractive and dilative responses of porous materials can cause significant variations and instabilities in the development of excess pore-water pressure. The results suggest that the proposed SPH algorithm is stable and suitable for handling field-scale applications.},

Based on the mixture theory, two mathematical models using the apparent and intrinsic fluid densities are formulated. Compared with models from literature, our models correctly consider the spatial and temporal change of soil porosity. For numerical discretization, two overlapping layers of SPH particles are used to represent the two phases independently. The water phase is modeled as weakly-compressible Newtonian fluid, and the soil phase is modeled using an elastoplastic constitutive model. A corrected Shepard filter is proposed to achieve C1 particle consistency. A new method is proposed to realize the free-slip boundary condition. Some other issues in numerical implementation such as interface treatment, and simulation initialization are discussed. Through three validation cases, it is demonstrated that both models provide accurate simulations well corroborated by analytical results. Moreover, the intrinsic density-based formulation (IDF) gives more accurate numerical results and more stable simulations.

CRB ground waters contained up to 60 μM dissolved H2 and autotrophic microorganisms outnumbered heterotrophs. Stable carbon isotope measurements implied that autotrophic methanogenesis dominated this ecosystem and was coupled to the depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon. In laboratory experiments, H2, a potential energy source for bacteria, was produced by reactions between crushed basalt and anaerobic water. Microcosms containing only crushed basalt and ground water supported microbial growth. These results suggest that the CRB contains a lithoautotrophic microbial ecosystem that is independent of photosynthetic primary production.},

	abstract = {The suction bucket foundation is considered as an effective option for offshore wind turbines because of its advantages in rapid installation and recyclability. However, the depth of the suction bucket inserted into the seabed is shallower compared to the monopile. Earthquakes and liquefaction threaten the safety and stability of suction bucket foundations in the North Sea of Europe and the Chinese offshore where earthquakes are active and the seabed is prone to liquefaction. This paper investigated the behavior of the suction bucket foundation located in the liquefiable sand under earthquakes using an advanced liquefaction model. The FE-FD method with the cyclic mobility constitutive model for soil was used to carry out the nonlinear dynamic analyses. Responses of the excess pore water pressure ratio, acceleration, displacement, and rotation were studied under different earthquake magnitudes and sand density. The distribution of excess pore water pressure of the suction bucket foundation from the results show strong space-time characteristics. The failure mechanism of the suction bucket foundation after liquefaction was revealed. The numerical results indicate that offshore wind turbines will be subjected to permanent displacements and tilt to reach 40\% of the safety threshold due to earthquakes and liquefaction. Thus, seismic load and liquefaction of the foundation must be considered in the design.},

	abstract = {Safe installation of suction caissons requires a reliable preliminary study where soil resistance and other soil conditions are predicted with good accuracy. Past studies did not address the full problem when modelling the installation procedure of suction caissons in sand. Suction was prescribed at the mudline and soil resistance was predicted based on soil properties and the resulting seepage profile around the caisson wall. Suction magnitude was assumed to overcome soil resistance, limiting its magnitude to avoid critical conditions such as piping. Most of these studies did not address other important parameters such as pumping rate and water depth. This paper addresses the following points: Feasibility of the installation depends on the water depth and hence, this must be specified as part of the installation design. Suction magnitude in excess to the initial hydrostatic pressure corresponds to a certain pumping rate, which is the parameter to control for a safe installation. A full numerical model is proposed in this paper to consider a prescribed pumping rate at the center of the caisson lid and the resulting flow inside the caisson cavity. The model was implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics and used to perform simulations of suction assisted installation in sand. Prescribed pumping rates have been investigated in conjunction with mobilized soil resistance, critical piping, water depth and available driving pressure.},

	abstract = {This paper was developed in cooperation between the TUHH and Overdick GmbH \& Co. KG. The goal of the presented work is gaining further knowledge about the installation and bearing behavior of suction bucket foundations for fixed offshore platforms based on sand.Buckets are usually made of steel and consist of a cylinder and a lid at the top. They are installed into the sea floor by pumping water out of the buckets to create suction, which drives the bucket into the soil. Suction buckets do not require heavy hammer-equipment for construction like common piles. Thus the installation procedure is much faster and protects the environment significantly by avoiding noise emissions. Therefore, suction buckets are to be considered as a serious foundation alternative compared to steel piles.For this paper numerical investigations are performed with the finite analyses software ABAQUS. A total of five finite element models — three for the bearing and two for the installation — were created to carry out parametric studies, while using a hypoplastic constitutive model to describe the soil conditions. Therefore, the buckets diameter, embedded depth and the pore-ratio are to be investigated. In addition three different load conditions are applied in the bearing capacity tests: the maximum vertical load, the maximum horizontal load and the minimum vertical load. During the simulation of the installation procedure different pore ratios are tested and it is attempted to simulate an installation by water-extraction.Based on these numerical investigations it is possible to investigate known and currently more or less unknown phenomena of the bearing and the installation of suction buckets. Thus, a more detailed knowledge about the function of this kind of foundation is to be gained. In addition, the numerical studies are compared to the design-procedure according to API RP-2A-WSD and the DNV CN-30.4.},

To ensure the reliability of finite element simulation results as much as possible, two well-known constitutive models, the Modified Cam-Clay model (MCC) and the Hardening Soil model (HS), are adopted respectively for the foundation soil which is normally consolidated clay with parameters directly determined from laboratory tests instead of inverse analysis or fitting using simple models in previous studies. The finite element analyses using both models are validated by comparing centrifugal tests and further extended to study the failure patterns in V–H–M (Vertical force–Horizontal force–Moment) space through radial displacement tests. Based on all results, two new alternative analytical formulations based on both models are then proposed to describe the three-dimensional (3D) failure envelope in V–H–M space. Finally, two new alternative macro-element design models of suction bucket foundation in clay under the same framework of hypoplasticity for both monotonic and cyclic loading conditions are proposed. By comparing with experimental results, the effectiveness and efficiency of both macro-element models are verified applicable and the one based on HS has slightly better performance than the one of MCC.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Reservoir stimulation is akey technology to enabling carbon and renewable resources recovery from the subsurface. The combination of pulse- and fluid-driven fracture propagation has great potential to revolutionize the hydro-fracturing industry. In this study, we present a novel method that extends the existing traction-at-split-node method to allow mode-I fracture propagation in both dynamic and quasi-static time frames. We implement this method in an open-source code, Defmod, that adaptively alternates between quasi-static and dynamic governing equations. We introduce a quasi-linear weakening failure criterion that allows irreversible tensile failures. To couple the fracture development and fluid flow inside and outside the fracture, we introduce a method to modify the fracture's neighboring elements by an anisotropic permeability as a function of fracture width. To ensure mass conservation, we balance the fluid-injection volume with the fracture-opening volume, by defining virtual fluid sources in the neighboring elements. We first compare an example of two-dimensional (2D) pulse-driven fracturing with experimental results. Then we compare an example of 3D penny-shaped hydraulic fracture, developing from a pressurized borehole, against the analytical Kristianovich-Geertsma-de Klerk (KGD) solution.INTRODUCTION. Numerically modeling tensile fracture propagation is of great interest in reservoir engineering (Chuprakov et al., 2011; Dahi-Taleghani and Olson, 2011; Jiang et al., 2015). Under in-situ stress conditions, natural rock failures are mostly in shear modes, such as fault activation, while tensile failures are sometimes attributed to magma/dike intrusions (Rivalta and Dahm, 2006; Aydin et al., 2006; Rutqvist et al., 2008). Induced tensile failure, typically hydraulic fracturing, has been widely used to enhance tight reservoirs’ permeability and greatly made unconventional hydrocarbon and geothermal resources accessible (Rubinstein and Mahani, 2015; Li et al., 2019). Several numerical methods have been applied to model hydraulic fracturing, such as the cohesive-zone method, extended finite-element method, and boundary-element method (Chen et al., 2021; Jin, 2018). We extend a well established traction-at-split-node (TSN) method, which has a strong track record for modeling dynamic fault ruptures (Day et al., 2005; Dalguer and Day, 2007), to model tensile failures.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown to be effective tools for solving both forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs). PINNs embed the PDEs into the loss of the neural network using automatic differentiation, and this PDE loss is evaluated at a set of scattered spatio-temporal points (called residual points). The location and distribution of these residual points are highly important to the performance of PINNs. However, in the existing studies on PINNs, only a few simple residual point sampling methods have mainly been used. Here, we present a comprehensive study of two categories of sampling for PINNs: non-adaptive uniform sampling and adaptive nonuniform sampling. We consider six uniform sampling methods, including (1) equispaced uniform grid, (2) uniformly random sampling, (3) Latin hypercube sampling, (4) Halton sequence, (5) Hammersley sequence, and (6) Sobol sequence. We also consider a resampling strategy for uniform sampling. To improve the sampling efficiency and the accuracy of PINNs, we propose two new residual-based adaptive sampling methods: residual-based adaptive distribution (RAD) and residual-based adaptive refinement with distribution (RAR-D), which dynamically improve the distribution of residual points based on the PDE residuals during training. Hence, we have considered a total of 10 different sampling methods, including six non-adaptive uniform sampling, uniform sampling with resampling, two proposed adaptive sampling, and an existing adaptive sampling. We extensively tested the performance of these sampling methods for four forward problems and two inverse problems in many setups. Our numerical results presented in this study are summarized from more than 6000 simulations of PINNs. We show that the proposed adaptive sampling methods of RAD and RAR-D significantly improve the accuracy of PINNs with fewer residual points for both forward and inverse problems. The results obtained in this study can also be used as a practical guideline in choosing sampling methods.},

As direct observations of these quantities are limited to well locations, a reliable methodology that predicts the spatial distribution of the quantities from well observations is required. In this study, we developed a physics-informed neural network (PINN), which constrains predictions to satisfy conservation of mass and energy, for predicting spatial distributions of temperature, pressure, and permeability of natural-state hydrothermal systems. We assessed the characteristics of the proposed method by applying it to 2D synthetic models of geothermal systems. Our results showed that the PINN outperformed the conventional neural network in terms of prediction accuracy. Among the PINN-predicted quantities, the errors in the predicted temperatures in the unexplored regions were significantly reduced. Furthermore, we confirmed that the predictions decreased the loss of the conservation laws. Thus, our PINN approach guarantees physical plausibility, which has been impossible using existing machine learning approaches. As permeability investigations in geothermal wells are often limited, we also demonstrate that the resistivity model obtained using the magnetotelluric method is effective in supplementing permeability observations and improving its prediction accuracy. This study demonstrated for the first time the usefulness of the PINN to a geothermal energy problem.},

MPINNs are encoded with the governing laws of physics, including the energy balance equation and Arrhenius law, ensuring accurate estimation of time and space-dependent temperature and dimensionless concentration in comparison to a purely data-driven approach. Specifically, the network is trained using data from a high-fidelity model of an LIB, which describes TR by addressing several coupled partial differential equations. Quantitative analysis reveals that the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of the MPINN for TR estimation are less than an artificial neural network (ANN) by 0.71 and 1.57, respectively, when using fully labeled data for training. It outperforms the ANN in terms of MAE and RMSE by 90.56 and 118.64, when only a small portion of labeled data (semi-supervision) are used for TR prediction. Importantly, it predicts TR without any labeled data when the decomposition of reactive species is modeled in the positive electrode. The MPINN exhibits promising results in surrogate modeling, implying it can be successfully implemented in practical scenarios and stimulate further research related to TR modeling using physics-informed deep learning.},

	abstract = {Natural hydrogen has been widely detected in many environments. However, up to date, the knowledge about the occurrence of hydrogen in the geological formation is very limited. Clay minerals with large adsorption capacities due to their huge specific surface area are widely distributed in the subsurface. In order to find whether the hydrogen can be adsorbed on the clay minerals, 6 types of clay minerals (montmorillonite, chlorite, sepiolite, palygorskite, kaolinite and illite) were used for the hydrogen adsorption analysis at various temperatures (0, 25, 45, and 75 °C) and pressures (up to 18 MPa). In addition, multi-scale simulations via density functional theory (DFT) and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) were carried out to further explore the hydrogen adsorption mechanism of clay minerals in bulk phase. The results show that the excess adsorption capacities of sepiolite and palygorskite are much higher than those of montmorillonite and chlorite, and the excess adsorption capacities of illite and kaolinite are very low, nearly reaching the detection limit. The variation of hydrogen adsorption capacity (HAC) in different clays is attributed to the difference in their pore structures (i.e., specific surface area). A more complex pore structure and a larger specific surface area could provide more sorption sites for hydrogen molecules. HAC increases with pressure and decreases with temperature irrespective of the clay mineral types. This study highlights the features of hydrogen adsorption in clay minerals, contributes to a better understanding of natural hydrogen occurrence and storage in the subsurface, providing the potential application for geological hydrogen exploration.},

The results of this research show that hydrogen has been discovered in oceanic spreading centers, transform faults, passive margins, convergent margins, and intraplate settings. The primary sources of the hydrogen include alterations in Fe(II)-containing rocks, the radiolysis of water, degassed magma, and the reaction of water- and silica-containing rocks during the mechanical fracturing. Hydrogen can appear in free gas, it can be adsorbed and trapped in inclusions. Currently, natural hydrogen exploration is in its infancy.

	abstract = {Beyond its role as an energy vector, a growing number of natural hydrogen sources and reservoirs are being discovered all over the globe, which could represent a clean energy source. Although the hydrogen amounts in reservoirs are uncertain, they could be vast, and they could help decarbonize energy-intensive economic sectors and facilitate the energy transition. Natural hydrogen is mainly produced through a geochemical process known as serpentinization, which involves the reaction of water with low-silica, ferrous minerals. In favorable locations, the hydrogen produced can become trapped by impermeable rocks on its way to the atmosphere, forming a reservoir. The safe exploitation of numerous natural hydrogen reservoirs seems feasible with current technology, and several demonstration plants are being commissioned. Natural hydrogen may show variable composition and require custom separation, purification, storage, and distribution facilities, depending on the location and intended use. By investing in research, in the mid-term, more hydrogen sources could become exploitable and geochemical processes could be artificially stimulated in new locations. In the long term, it may be possible to leverage or engineer the interplay between microorganisms and geological substrates to obtain hydrogen and other chemicals in a sustainable manner.},

If the cost of producing hydrogen falls far below that of fossil fuels, it will be able to run the transportation, construction, and energy sectors. The vision of a decarbonized future in which hydrogen is used as a common fuel will be realized soon through infrastructural developments. Aluminum (Al) and water react to produce hydrogen on-site, which is a simple and affordable process. Two benefits come from this: first, it eliminates the need for additional logistics for the storage and shipping of hydrogen; second, water is easily accessible in the field and Al is safer to use. Although this technique appears intriguing, a major barrier to its wide-spread applications is the development of a passive oxide layer on the Al surface. The advantages and disadvantages of various Al activation techniques are covered in this review article. In addition to analyzing the effectiveness and technical issues of the Al-water reaction techniques used to power on-site hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles, it gives a critical examination of key parameters that derive the Al-water reaction mechanism.},

In this study, we have conducted pore-scale modeling to investigate the effects of pore geometry and injection rate on the occurrence and efficiency of residual trapping via dead-end bypassing. We begin our theoretical and numerical analyses using a single rectangular pore to understand the key controls in bypassing. We further investigated two factors affecting bypassing: (a) a continuous cycle of injection-extraction of H2, and (b) variable pore geometry. Based on our pore-scale simulations, we found that: (a) a higher pore height/width ratio (h/w) and a higher injection rate cause more residual trapping, which is unfavorable for withdrawal of H2; (b) the trapping percentage increases with the h/w first and then decreases after h/w reaches 0.5; (c) and a converging-shaped pore can result in less trapping volume. Based on a theoretical comparison of the residual trapping behavior of H2 and CO2, we discuss the mechanisms that are applicable to CO2 residual trapping and the possibility of developing engineering controls of H2 storage and production.},

	abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments was conducted to investigate serpentinization of olivine–pyroxene mixtures at 230 °C, with the objective of evaluating the effect of mixed compositions on Fe partitioning among product minerals, H2 generation, and reaction rates. An initial experiment reacted a mixture of 86 wt.\% olivine and 14 wt.\% orthopyroxene (Opx) with the same initial grain size for 387 days. The experiment resulted in extensive reaction (∼53\% conversion), and solids recovered at termination of the experiment were dominated by Fe-bearing chrysotile and relict olivine along with minor brucite and magnetite. Only limited amounts of H2 were generated during the first ∼100 days of the experiment, but the rate of H2 generation then increased sharply coincident with an increase in pH from mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline conditions. Two shorter term experiments with the same reactants (26 and 113 days) produced a mixture of lizardite and talc that formed a thin coating on relict olivine and Opx grains, with virtually no generation of H2. Comparison of the results with reaction path models indicates that the Opx reacted about two times faster than olivine, which contrasts with some previous studies that suggested olivine should react more rapidly than Opx at the experimental conditions. The models also indicate that the long-term experiment transitioned from producing serpentine ± talc early in the early stages to precipitation of serpentine plus magnetite, with brucite beginning to precipitate only late in the experiment as Opx was depleted. The results indicate that overall reaction of olivine and Opx was initially relatively slow, but reaction rates accelerated substantially when the pH transitioned to strongly alkaline conditions. Serpentine and brucite precipitated from the olivine-Opx mixture had higher Fe contents than observed in olivine-only experiments at mildly alkaline pH, but had comparable Fe contents to reaction of olivine at strongly alkaline pH implying that higher pH may favor greater partitioning of Fe into serpentine and brucite and less into magnetite. Despite the presence of brucite, dissolved silica activities during the long-term olivine-Opx experiment maintained levels well above serpentine-brucite equilibrium. Instead, silica activities converged on levels close to metastable equilibrium between brucite and olivine. It is proposed that silica levels during the experiment may have been regulated by exchange of SiO2 between the fluid and a silica-depleted, brucite-like surface layer on dissolving olivine.},

	abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged recently as a promising application of deep neural networks to the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, it has been recognized that adaptive procedures are needed to force the neural network to fit accurately the stubborn spots in the solution of "stiff" PDEs. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new way to train PINNs adaptively, where the adaptation weights are fully trainable and applied to each training point individually, so the neural network learns autonomously which regions of the solution are difficult and is forced to focus on them. The self-adaptation weights specify a soft multiplicative soft attention mask, which is reminiscent of similar mechanisms used in computer vision. The basic idea behind these SA-PINNs is to make the weights increase as the corresponding losses increase, which is accomplished by training the network to simultaneously minimize the losses and maximize the weights. We show how to build a continuous map of self-adaptive weights using Gaussian Process regression, which allows the use of stochastic gradient descent in problems where conventional gradient descent is not enough to produce accurate solutions. Finally, we derive the Neural Tangent Kernel matrix for SA-PINNs and use it to obtain a heuristic understanding of the effect of the self-adaptive weights on the dynamics of training in the limiting case of infinitely-wide PINNs, which suggests that SA-PINNs work by producing a smooth equalization of the eigenvalues of the NTK matrix corresponding to the different loss terms. In numerical experiments with several linear and nonlinear benchmark problems, the SA-PINN outperformed other state-of-the-art PINN algorithm in L2 error, while using a smaller number of training epochs.},

	abstract = {The low-temperature alteration ({\textless} 150 °C) of ophiolites by infiltrated meteoric waters removes atmospheric CO2 through mineral carbonation and is assumed to generate H2 and possibly CH4 according to so-called serpentinization reactions. This overall alteration pattern is primarily constrained by the chemical composition of alkaline springs that are issued in several ophiolites worldwide. Here we report on the fingerprint, as veinlet mineralization, of the reactive percolation of such meteoric waters in the New Caledonia ophiolite (Massif du Sud). The mineralization which resulted from carbonation and serpentinization reactions, is young ({\textless} 2 Ma) and formed at a temperature of ca. 95 °C. It is mainly composed of lizardite, dolomite, magnetite ± pyroaurite. Thermochemical simulation of mineral–water equilibria shows that the percolating aqueous fluid was alkaline and H2 bearing. The δ13C of dolomite is exceptionally high, between 7.1 and up to 17.3‰, and is interpreted as evidence of low-temperature methanogenesis. Overall, the percolating fluid had a chemical composition similar to that of the waters issued today in the (hyper)alkaline springs of the Massif du Sud. The studied veinlets are thus interpreted as a sample of the plumbing system that fed an ancient Quaternary alkaline spring in the area.},

	abstract = {The Samail Ophiolite in Oman, the largest exposed body of ultramafic rocks at the Earth’s surface, produces a continuous flux of hydrogen through low-temperature water/rock reactions. In turn, the scale of the subsurface microbial biosphere is sufficient to consume much of this hydrogen, except where H2 is delivered to surface seeps via faults. By integrating data from recent investigations into the alteration history of the peridotites, groundwater dynamics, and the serpentinite-hosted microbial communities, we identify feasible subsurface conditions for a pilot demonstration of stimulated geological hydrogen production. A simple technoeconomic analysis shows that the stimulation methods to be used must increase the rate of net hydrogen production at least 10,000-fold compared to the estimated natural rate to economically produce hydrogen from engineered water/rock reactions in the peridotite formations. It may be possible to meet this challenge within the upper 1–2 km, given the projected availability of reactive Fe(II)-bearing phases and the lower drilling costs associated with shallower operations. Achieving ≥10,000-fold increases in the H2 production rate will require a combination of stimuli. It will likely be necessary to increase the density of fracturing in the reaction volume by at least two orders of magnitude. Then, the H2-production rates must also be increased by another two orders of magnitude by increasing the water/rock ratio and modifying the chemistry of the injected fluids to optimize formation of Fe(III)-bearing secondary phases. These fluid modifications must be designed to simultaneously minimize microbial consumption of H2 within the stimulation volume. In contrast, preserving the high potentials for biological H2 consumption in the shallow groundwaters replete with oxidants such as nitrate, sulfate and dissolved inorganic carbon will reduce the potential for any inadvertent leaks of hydrogen to the atmosphere, where it acts as an indirect greenhouse gas.},

	abstract = {The opaque mineralogy and the contents and isotope compositions of sulfur in serpentinized peridotites from the MARK (Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Kane Fracture Zone) area were examined to understand the conditions of serpentinization and evaluate this process as a sink for seawater sulfur. The serpentinites contain a sulfur-rich secondary mineral assemblage and have high sulfur contents (up to 1 wt.\%) and elevated δ34Ssulfide (3.7 to 12.7‰). Geochemical reaction modeling indicates that seawater-peridotite interaction at 300 to 400°C alone cannot account for both the high sulfur contents and high δ34Ssulfide. These require a multistage reaction with leaching of sulfide from subjacent gabbro during higher temperature (∼400°C) reactions with seawater and subsequent deposition of sulfide during serpentinization of peridotite at ∼300°C. Serpentinization produces highly reducing conditions and significant amounts of H2 and results in the partial reduction of seawater carbonate to methane. The latter is documented by formation of carbonate veins enriched in 13C (up to 4.5‰) at temperatures above 250°C. Although different processes produce variable sulfur isotope effects in other oceanic serpentinites, sulfur is consistently added to abyssal peridotites during serpentinization. Data for serpentinites drilled and dredged from oceanic crust and from ophiolites indicate that oceanic peridotites are a sink for up to 0.4 to 6.0 × 1012 g seawater S yr−1. This is comparable to sulfur exchange that occurs in hydrothermal systems in mafic oceanic crust at midocean ridges and on ridge flanks and amounts to 2 to 30\% of the riverine sulfate source and sedimentary sulfide sink in the oceans. The high concentrations and modified isotope compositions of sulfur in serpentinites could be important for mantle metasomatism during subduction of crust generated at slow spreading rates.},

At temperatures from 25 to 300°C (P = 10 to 100 bar), using either fresh water or seawater, serpentinization simulations produce an assemblage commonly observed in natural systems, dominated by serpentine, magnetite, and brucite. The reacted waters in the simulations show similar trends in composition with decreasing water-rock ratios, becoming hyper-alkaline and strongly reducing, with increased dissolved calcium. At 25°C and w/r less than ∼32, conditions are sufficiently reducing to yield H2 gas, nickel-iron alloy and native copper. Hyperalkalinity results from OH− production by olivine and pyroxene dissolution in the absence of counterbalancing OH− consumption by alteration mineral precipitation except at very high pH; at moderate pH there are no stable calcium minerals and only a small amount of chlorite forms, limited by aluminum, thus allowing Mg2+ and Ca2+ to accumulate in the aqueous phase in exchange for H+. The reducing conditions result from oxidation of ferrous iron in olivine and pyroxene to ferric iron in magnetite. Trace metals are computed to be nearly insoluble below 300°C, except for mercury, for which high pH stabilizes aqueous and gaseous Hg°. In serpentinization by seawater at 300°C, Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt may approach ore-forming concentrations in sulfide complexes. Simulated mixing of the fluid derived from serpentinization with cold seawater produces a mineral assemblage dominated by calcite, similar to recently discovered submarine, ultramafic rock-hosted, carbonate mineral deposits precipitating at hydrothermal vents. Simulated reaction of gabbroic or basaltic rocks with the hyperalkaline calcium- and aluminum-rich fluid produced during serpentinization at 300°C yields rodingite-type mineral assemblages, including grossular, clinozoisite, vesuvianite, prehnite, chlorite, and diopside.},

Thus fluid migration is associated with some process that creates the necessary channels for migration. One such mechanism is associated with the volume changes resulting from volatilization reactions. Petrographic studies of a partly serpentinized troctolite from the Duluth complex in Minnesota reveal how the increase in solid volume associated with hydration of olivine phenocrystals generates an extensive network of microfractures in the surrounding plagioclase-dominated matrix. This microfracture network allows hydrous fluids to penetrate further into the rock. A 2-D spring-network model illustrates how expanding polygons (or non-spherical grains) in an elastically deforming matrix cause dilatant microfracturing and porosity generation even if the overall stresses are compressive. The model emphasises how fluid infiltration may be promoted by stress heterogeneities set up by metamorphic reactions.},

Simple scaling laws relate the speed of the weathering front to elastic properties, the rate of transport of reactants, and reaction rates. Five different regimes in the model are identified, although only two of these are appropriate for natural systems, where the reaction rate is a key control on the weathering rate. The model is applied to the carbonation and serpentinization of peridotite, chemical weathering processes which have potential industrial application in the storage of CO2. If these weathering processes can be accelerated, CO2 could be stored as carbonates in the peridotite in substantial quantities. This simple model suggests that it may be possible to boost the speed of the weathering front a millionfold by a combination of heating, increased partial pressure of CO2, forced fluid flow, and hydrofracture.},

Which of these outcomes emerges in specific cases is determined in part by the “crystallization pressure”, which creates local gradients in pressure around growing crystals, and thus a differential stress. We develop thermodynamic and mineral physics estimates of the crystallization pressure and differential stress resulting from volume changes during olivine hydration (serpentinization) and carbonation. Because olivine is so far from equilibrium with fluids near the surface, the stress due to serpentinization and/or carbonation may exceed 300MPa at temperatures up to 200°C or more, greater than required to fracture rocks and cause frictional failure in the upper 10km of the Earth. Provided that fluid access is initiated, for example along pre-existing fractures, the volume change due to hydration and carbonation can cause fracture formation and dilation, maintaining or increasing permeability and reactive surface energy in a positive feedback mechanism.},

With a computational tool developed based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), we simulated the hopper flow and auger feeding of six granular biomass materials. The good agreement between the experimental and numerical flow rates demonstrated the capability of the developed SPH solver in modeling the complicated flow of granular biomass materials. The impact of physical and numerical parameters is investigated, and the major results show that the hopper flow pattern is controlled by shear band evolution; hopper clogging is collectively influenced by the opening size, wall friction, and material packing, and the impact of material compressibility on the auger feed rate is minimal. These parametric studies validate the solver’s robustness in simulating biomass flow in handling equipment and demonstrate that the SPH computational tool can provide insights about granular flow mechanics to facilitate handling equipment design and optimize handling operations.},

	abstract = {Failure of many brittle materials and structures can be modeled using interface-oriented finite elements combined with intrinsic cohesive zone models. The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method provides an innovative framework for modeling brittle crack propagation with zero-thickness interface elements, which can accommodate extrinsic cohesive laws to avoid the artificial compliance required in intrinsic cohesive models. However, robust formulations and implementations of DG methods are critical in alleviating the well-known convergence issues for both crack nucleation and propagation with reduced instability. This paper presents a robust interface element formulation by modifying the incomplete interior penalty Galerkin (IIPG) method, which successfully avoids the initial element interface penetration across elements that occurs prior to crack nucleation, and thereby greatly reduces the instability issue as cracks open. We further verified and validated our implementation by using a bar tension test and a beam fracturing benchmark. The robustness of our proposed interface element method was demonstrated by a micromechanics fiber/matrix debonding problem with 64 fibers embedded in a bulk matrix.},

	abstract = {Rising mining costs and fewer high-grade ore deposits have necessitated a search for alternative methods for the recovery of metals from deposits that are no longer economically or environmentally exploitable by conventional mining. One such alternative method is in-situ recovery (ISR). Although ISR has typically been used for mining uranium ores that are not economic to mine with conventional methods, it has also been used less frequently for the treatment of other low permeability rocks, such as hard rocks containing copper, nickel, and gold. The reason for the limited uptake of the technology for hard rock mineralization is primarily due to the low natural rock porosity and permeability and hence limited ability of a lixiviant to permeate the rock and contact the minerals. This review focuses on three novel potential access creation methods: microwaves, high-voltage pulses, and cryogenic fracturing procedures. Most research studies of microwaves and high voltage pulses have focused on energy savings in comminution, but little research has been done on their application of in ISR. In situ cryogenic fracturing has been used in the petroleum industry and may be a potential novel option for use for the in situ recovery of minerals in the mining industry. The aim of this review is to summarize available information on these three methods for increasing the permeability of hard rocks and thereby improving the rate of lixiviant-mineral contact and mass transfer in in-situ recovery. The review will start with an overview of considerations for the use of ISR. The mechanisms of microwave, high-voltage pulse, and cryogenic fracturing methods will then be discussed.},

	abstract = {Global energy and material consumption are expected to rise in exponential proportions during the next few decades, generating huge demands for deep earth energy (oil/gas) recovery and mineral processing. Under such circumstances, the continuation of existing methods in rock fragmentation in such applications is questionable due to the proven adverse environmental impacts associated with them. In this regard; the possibility of using more environmentally friendly options as Soundless Chemical Demolition Agents (SCDAs) play a vital role in replacing harmful conventional rock fragmentation techniques for gas; oil and mineral recovery. This study reviews up to date research on soundless cracking demolition agent (SCDA) application on rock fracturing including its limitations and strengths, possible applications in the petroleum industry and the possibility of using existing rock fragmentation models for SCDA-based rock fragmentation; also known as fracking. Though the expansive properties of SCDAs are currently used in some demolition works, the poor usage guidelines available reflect the insufficient research carried out on its material’s behavior. SCDA is a cementitious powdery substance with quicklime (CaO) as its primary ingredient that expands upon contact with water; which results in a huge expansive pressure if this CaO hydration reaction occurs in a confined condition. So, the mechanism can be used for rock fragmentation by injecting the SCDA into boreholes of a rock mass; where the resulting expansive pressure is sufficient to create an effective fracture network in the confined rock mass around the borehole. This expansive pressure development, however, dependent on many factors, where formation water content creates a negative influence on this due to required greater degree of hydration under greater water contents and temperature creates a positive influence by accelerating the reaction. Having a precise understanding of the fracture propagation mechanisms when using SCDA is important due to the formation of complex fracture networks in rocks. Several models can be found in the literature based on the tangential and radial stresses acting on a rock mass surrounding an SCDA charged borehole. Those fracture models with quasi-static fracturing mechanism that occurs in Mode I type tensile failure show compatibility with SCDA fracturing mechanisms. The effect of borehole diameter, spacing and the arrangement on expansive pressure generation and corresponding fracture network generation is important in the SCDA fracturing process and effective handling of them would pave the way to creating an optimum fracture network in a targeted rock formation. SCDA has many potential applications in unconventional gas and oil recovery and in-situ mining in mineral processing. However, effective utilization of SCDA in such application needs much extensive research on the performance of SCDA with respect to its potential applications, particularly when considering unique issues arising in using SCDA in different applications.},

The main focus of the review will be the newly developed non-destructible rock fragmentation method, slow releasing energy material agent (SREMA), which is a modified soundless chemical demolition agent (SCDA). The review aims to address one of the main gaps in studies related to SREMA, by presenting a thorough understanding of the components of SREMA and their mechanisms of action, leading to volume expansion. Thus, this review would act as a guide for researchers working on using expansive materials for rock breaking. As many literatures have not been published regarding the recently discovered SREMA, studies on cements, expansive cements, and soundless chemical demolition agents (SCDA) were mainly considered. The chemical reactions and volume expansive processes of these materials have been studied and incorporated with the additives included in SREMA, to understand its behavior. Literature containing experimental studies analyzing the heat of hydration and microstructural changes have been mostly considered along with some of the heavily discussed hypotheses regarding the hydration of certain components, to predict the volume expansive mechanism of SREMA. Studies related to SREMA and other similar materials have shown drastic changes in the heats of hydration as the composition varies. Thus, SREMA has the capability of giving a wider range of expansive energies in diverse environmental conditions},

	abstract = {Demand for technologies delivering renewable energy and improving energy efficiencies are set to increase with the worldwide movement towards low carbon economies. Many of these technologies are reliant on “critical metals”: metals considered both important to society and vulnerable to supply disruption. Significant concentrations of critical metals have reported to mining and processing wastes over time; thus, an opportunity exists to meet critical metal demand through re-processing of these wastes. Mining and processing wastes have significantly different properties to run of mine ores. This means that while the overall mineral processing sequence for mining and processing wastes is the same as run of mine ore, the best technologies to achieve the liberation, separation, and concentration of critical metals is different. There are a range of innovative technologies that can be used to liberate and separate critical metals from mining and processing waste. Mineral liberation can be achieved using stirred milling, which breaks up particles and removes hydrophilic surface that can prevent particle flotation. Particle separation based on size can be achieved using semi-inverted cyclones and hybrid classification technologies. Separation of minerals from gangue can be achieved using flotation, with fluidised bed reactors and reactor-separator induced air reactors being suitable for coarse and fine particles, respectively. Gravity concentration using counter flow fluidised bed separators is also suitable for separating minerals from gangue. This review provides an overview of these technologies, as well as an introduction to the sequence of events when undertaking mineral processing, for an audience not specialised in this discipline. However, extraction of any metal value from tailings is contingent on detailed mineralogical characterisation. Three case studies are presented to demonstrate the analysis that is necessary as a crucial first step towards valorisation. Ultimately, implementation of these technologies to extract critical metals from mining and processing wastes will not only aid in meeting future critical metal demand but is essential for achieving a sustainable circular mining system with near-zero waste.},

It is widely used for uranium production and is increasingly being considered for the extraction of copper and other metals. Evaluating ISR mining projects requires a reliable prediction of the operational and commercial potential for extracting minerals by ISR. The predicted production can be evaluated by simulating the solution extraction process in the subsurface using reactive transport modelling techniques. This paper presents a case study in which the in-situ copper recovery from an abandoned mine site at Kapunda, Australia is evaluated as part of a scoping study. In this study, copper leaching and the transport of the resulting solution under well operating conditions (injection and extraction) are modelled over the mining area. COMSOL Multiphysics was used to establish an integrated simulation model of reactive fluid flow through different domains, including wells, fractured rock masses and old underground workings from previous mining operations. This paper also describes the derivation of the major input parameters from site investigations including the estimation of hydraulic conductivity from the fracture information and the copper leaching rate from the initial leaching tests. The potential for the Kapunda mine site to become the first operating in-situ copper recovery mine in Australia is currently being evaluated and the project is currently at the scoping study stage. This paper contributes to the evaluation by presenting an ISR copper production model for the Kapunda site that can be used in an initial economic analysis.},

To overcome these problems, the application of in-place, in-situ, and heap leaching often represent an optimal solution that minimises the capital and operating costs associated with mining and processing operations. Non-toxic, low cost lixiviants that are stable over an extended range of pH and Eh are required to provide any practical solution to in-situ leaching (ISL). Since ISL has the inherent benefit of increased natural rock temperature and pressure, glycine-based systems can be considered to extract valuable metals. Based on earlier studies on glycine leaching of pure gold foil, this research shows that Western Australian paleochannel ores are amenable to glycine-based ISL, at elevated alkalinity. The effects of pH, temperature, free glycine, ferric ions, sodium chloride and solids percentages on the kinetics of gold extraction were assessed. More than 85\% of the gold can be extracted from ore with solutions containing 15 g/L glycine at pH 12.5 in 336 h. The presence of ferric ions did not improve the gold extraction, and most of the ferric has been precipitated from the leach solutions, implying that the chosen ferric complex was not sufficiently stable at the operating pH. The impurities dissolution during glycine leach was very low and highly selective leaching of gold over gangue was observed.},

	abstract = {Recent decreases in the grades of copper reserves have stimulated interest in alternative mining technologies, such as in-situ recovery (ISR), which may be an attractive mining approach for low-grade ores. In ISR operations, lixiviant contacts subsurface ore when it is pumped through the deposit. Continuous flow of lixiviant with suitable properties (such as pH and solution potential, Eh) is required from the wellfield injection point through the ore to the recovery point. Leach solution pH and Eh adjustment is not possible between boreholes and therefore, undesired precipitate formation may result, which could produce blockages and restrict solution flow. Our experiments aimed to simulate the chemical processes that may occur when leach solution travels through an ore deposit from the injection to the recovery well by contacting a pregnant leach solution with fresh ore over multiple stages. Low-grade natural ore that contained refractory copper sulfides mixed with gangue minerals was leached with iron (III) as an oxidant in sulfuric, hydrochloric or methanesulfonic acid at 90 °C. The leach solution was contacted for 72 h with fresh ore in five successive stages, without acid or oxidant replenishment. Although copper extraction continued for the duration of the five stages, the copper extraction dropped off after two contact stages. Precipitates formed in all solutions after three contact stages; akaganeite precipitated in the chloride systems and jarosite and gypsum formed in the sulfate systems after the second contact stage. The extent of precipitation is predicted to increase with an increase in temperature and pH. These findings provide insights into the behaviour that could be expected in ISR operations and factors that influence borehole spacing and ensure continuous lixiviant–ore contact subsurface.},

	abstract = {Mineral consumption is increasing rapidly as more consumers enter the market for minerals and as the global standard of living increases. As a result, underground mining continues to progress to deeper levels in order to tackle the mineral supply crisis in the 21st century. However, deep mining occurs in a very technical and challenging environment, in which significant innovative solutions and best practice are required and additional safety standards must be implemented in order to overcome the challenges and reap huge economic gains. These challenges include the catastrophic events that are often met in deep mining engineering: rockbursts, gas outbursts, high in situ and redistributed stresses, large deformation, squeezing and creeping rocks, and high temperature. This review paper presents the current global status of deep mining and highlights some of the newest technological achievements and opportunities associated with rock mechanics and geotechnical engineering in deep mining. Of the various technical achievements, unmanned working-faces and unmanned mines based on fully automated mining and mineral extraction processes have become important fields in the 21st century.},

	abstract = {A new, high-efficiency technology for fracturing and breaking rocks is required. Due to various advantages including high efficiency, energy-saving, and having no secondary pollution, the technology of microwave-induced fracturing of hard rock has been considered as a potential method for rock fracturing and breaking. Aiming at the realisation of two engineering applications: microwave-assisted mechanical rock breaking and stress release from rock masses in deep underground engineering works to prevent geological disasters caused by high-stress concentrations such as rockbursts, a novel (open-type) microwave-induced fracturing apparatus (OMWFA) for fracturing hard rocks was developed. On this basis, the two modes of microwave-induced subsurface fracturing and microwave-induced borehole fracturing of hard rocks were proposed. Due to removal of the restraint of the microwave cavity, OMWFA can be used to fracture large-size rock samples and engineering-scale rock masses. Using the apparatus, the fracturing effects of the two fracturing modes on different dimensions of cuboidal basalt samples were investigated. By combining the microwave-induced fracturing apparatus with a press machine to explore the influence of unidirectional stress on the fracturing effect of microwave treatment on basalt. Moreover, field tests were carried out on rock masses encountered in underground engineering works at Baihetan Hydropower Station in Sichuan Province, China, and the fracturing effects were evaluated by applying a digital borehole televiewer and conducting acoustic wave testing. The results show that the apparatus had favourable fracturing effects on the subsurface and borehole samples of basalt. When no stress was applied, the cracks radially expanded from the approximate centre of the radiant surface and unidirectional stress promoted fracturing. The number and depth of cracks increased with prolonged microwave exposure. After microwave treatment, the P-wave velocity of the samples declined, and the longer the microwave exposure, the more significant the reduction in P-wave velocity was. The results of field test reveal that borehole fracturing can exhibit a favourable effect around boreholes. The sound velocity around the borehole and between the boreholes both declined to some extent. Microwave-induced hard rock fracturing offers guiding significance to those exploring and developing new rock breaking and tunnelling methods, and generally enhances construction safety in deep underground engineering works.},

The borehole fracturing technology for hard rocks may be used to relieve stress on rock masses encountered in deep underground engineering works and prevent geological disasters triggered by high stress concentration. However, owing to microwaves causing selective heating, different types of rocks show different heating effects. Based on microwave heating experiments on multiple types of rocks, three typical rocks with different heating effects were investigated. According to X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and microscope images, the primary mineral compositions of rocks and microstructures of minerals were determined. By employing an infrared thermal imager, the distribution of surface temperature of samples were measured. Afterwards, according to sensitivity to microwaves and thermal expansion of rock-forming minerals, the mechanism whereby different types of rocks show different heating effects was analysed. Chifeng basalt contains both minerals (pyroxene) sensitive to microwaves and minerals (olivine) with a high coefficient of thermal expansion, mainly manifesting itself as rock fracturing during microwave heating. As only minerals (pyroxene) sensitive to microwaves, while no minerals with high coefficients of thermal expansion were found in Anshan gabbro, the rock was mainly molten during microwave heating. Neither minerals sensitive to microwaves, nor minerals with a high coefficient of thermal expansion were contained in the Beishan granite, so these samples underwent no significant change before, or after, microwave irradiation},

Each technique was explained with the support of literature review. Specifically, this paper revealed that some fracking methods such as pulsed arc electrohydraulic discharges (PAED), plasma stimulation and fracturing technology (PSF), thermal (cryogenic) fracturing, enhanced bacterial methanogenesis, and heating of rock mass are at the concept stage for conventional and other unconventional resources. Thus, these found to be significant for stimulating natural gas wells, which provides very good production results.

	abstract = {The microwave-assisted mechanical rock breaking system is a rock fragmentation method which uses the combination of microwave heating technology and the mechanical excavating technology. Different minerals have different degrees of absorption to microwave energy, so intergranular and transgranular fractures occur within the specimen after microwave radiation treatment, and the specimen is weakened and micro cracks are generated due to the internal stress caused by thermal expansion of different minerals within the rocks. This causes the rock strength to be reduced. Microwave power and exposure time are the important parameters to influence the mechanical properties of rocks. The point load strength, tensile strength and compressive strength decrease significantly with a certain power level of microwave radiation. The higher the microwave power and the longer the exposure time, the more the strength reduction. The numerical results are compared with the experimental ones and show that the strength reduction is much quicker by increasing the power level of microwave in shorter time of exposure. The life and penetration rate of cutters of the rock mechanical equipment can be increased by the strength reduction of rocks, which can contribute to resolving the disc cutter wear problem. Microwave-assisted mechanical rock breaking has significant influence on drilling, TBM tunnelling and realizing the continuous mining of metal mine.},

	abstract = {The development of biofuels has been considered as an important countermeasure to abate anthropogenic CO2 emissions, suppress deteriorated atmospheric greenhouse effect, and mitigate global warming. To produce biofuels from biomass, thermochemical conversion processes are considered as the most efficient routes wherein torrefaction has the lowest global warming potential. Combustion is the easiest way to consume biomass, which can be burned alone or co-fired with coal to generate heat and power. However, solid biomass fuels are not commonly applied in the industry due to their characteristics of hygroscopic nature and high moisture content, low bulk density and calorific value, poor grindability, low compositional homogeneity, and lower resistance against biological degradation. In recently developing biomass conversion technologies, torrefaction has attracted much attention since it can effectively upgrade solid biomass and produce coal-like fuel. Torrefaction is categorized into dry and wet torrefaction; the former can further be split into non-oxidative and oxidative torrefaction. Despite numerous methods developed, non-oxidative torrefaction, normally termed torrefaction, has a higher potential for practical applications and commercialization when compared to other methods. To provide a comprehensive review of the progress in biomass torrefaction technologies, this study aims to perform an in-depth literature survey of torrefaction principles, processes, systems, and to identify a current trend in practical torrefaction development and environmental performance. Moreover, the encountered challenges and perspectives from torrefaction development are underlined. This state-of-the-art review is conducive to the production and applications of biochar for resource utilization and environmental sustainability. To date, several kinds of reactors have been developed, while there is still no obviously preferred one as they simultaneously have pros and cons. Integrating torrefaction with other processes such as co-firing, gasification, pyrolysis, and ironmaking, etc., makes it more efficient and economically feasible in contrast to using a single process. By virtue of capturing carbon dioxide during the growth stage of biomass, negative carbon emissions can even be achieved from torrefied biomass.},

	abstract = {Biomass is a promising renewable source that can reduce fossil fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions, but some of its characteristics make it difficult to use in its raw form. Torrefaction has been proposed as a thermochemical pretreatment to upgrade biomass for direct applications such as combustion and gasification, biochar and chemicals production, while reducing its transportation cost and increasing its shelf-life. Research, development, and demonstration of biomass torrefaction technologies have advanced during the last few decades, but many science and engineering fundamentals as well as technological challenges remain, especially in the areas of reaction thermodynamics and kinetics, reactor models and design, large-scale implementation, and environmental performance. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of recent developments in biomass torrefaction research and technology focusing on kinetics, particle and reactor scale models, and reactor designs. The impacts of torrefaction as a pretreatment of biomass on subsequent conversion processes, and the novel applications of torrefied biomass are discussed. The energy management, environmental impacts, economic and market potential of the technology as well as the deployment options are also addressed. There is no best universal torrefaction reactor and hence the choice should be made based on the biomass feedstock and the expected production rate and application. To reduce process costs and competition with other uses of biomass, the utilization of either waste or environmentally sustainable, more abundant, and faster growing biomass should be targeted for this technology. Torrefied biomass produced at higher temperatures resemble pyrolysis biochar in several properties thereby making it suitable for most biochar applications. Finally, considering the need to identify the bottlenecks that potentially could limit the use of torrefaction, and its preceding or subsequent processes, the future prospects, challenges, and opportunities of torrefaction technology are presented.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive one-dimensional model accounting for the effects of heat and mass transfer, chemical kinetics, and drying was developed to describe the torrefaction of a single woody biomass particle. The thermochemical sub-models depend only on previously determined or measured characteristics, avoiding the use of fitting or tuning parameters and enabling a rigorous energy balance of the process. Moreover, a high temperature drying sub-model is introduced which overcomes the difficulties associated with existing approaches to give physically consistent results, smooth implementation, and numerical stability. The particle model was validated against experimental data from the literature for intraparticle temperature profiles, particle mass and energy yields over a range of particle sizes and reaction temperatures. The modeling results describe well the three distinct stages observed during the torrefaction of large particles including the heatup, drying, heat release due to exothermic reactions resulting in thermal overshoot, followed by thermal equilibrium where conversion is governed by mass loss kinetics. The nonlinear effects of particle size, temperature, moisture content, and residence time on the mass and energy yields are quantified and explained. Larger particles exhibit a significant internal temperature gradient and strong temperature overshoot especially at the centerline. The magnitude of the overshoot is a function of the conductivity, particle size, and average heat release rate. Because of the rise in the reaction rate, higher temperatures increase the sensitivity of the process to particle size. Due to the dependence of drying rate on heat transfer limitations, the sensitivity of torrefaction to initial moisture content increases strongly with particle size.},

	abstract = {A mechanistic model of torrefaction was developed for a two-stage rotary reactor, and it was verified with experimental results. Mass and energy balances for each phase are considered in the model. A kinetic model that considers the progressive decomposition of biomass into volatiles and char released simultaneously from the raw biomass was coupled to the balances. Mathematical expressions for residence time, heat transfer coefficient, and bed height inside the kiln were taken from the literature for model calculations. Release of condensable and noncondensable volatiles from biomass during the process was considered in the gas phase, while the solid phase included raw and torrefied biomass. The model can predict different output parameters of torrefaction in a rotary continuous torrefier, such as final amounts of solids, gas yields, and temperatures, for different operational conditions. Properties for torrefied solid, such as high heating value, fixed carbon, and volatile matter, can also be predicted by the model through mathematical correlations obtained in a previous experimental work. The results obtained from the model were compared to experimental data, and good agreement was found.},

In order to realize this potential, suitable modeling frameworks must be constructed that effectively capture the multiscale complexity and tremendous variety exhibited by lignocellulosic materials. In our assessment of previous endeavors toward this goal, several important shortcomings have been identified: (1) the lack of multiscale integration strategies that capture emergent properties and behaviors spanning different length scales and (2) the inability of many modeling approaches to effectively capture the variability and diversity of lignocellulose that arise from both natural and process-induced sources. In this Perspective, we survey previous modeling approaches for lignocellulose and simulation processes involving its chemical and mechanical transformation and suggest opportunities for future development to enhance the utility of computational tools to address barriers to widespread adoption of a renewable bioeconomy.},

In order to predict the rate of the biomass decomposition (i.e., yield of the reaction products) and characterise the thermofluidynamics of the reactor, a heat, mass and momentum transfer model based on a finite volumes method (f.v.m.) representation has been developed and supplemented with a torrefaction kinetic model, consisting of a two-step scheme previously proposed. The kinetic model has been calibrated utilizing the results of thermogravimetric analysis applied to common reeds. Experimental tests have been also performed on reeds in a bench-scale batch apparatus, varying the main process parameters. The validation of the proposed kinetic scheme has been carried out following two different approaches. Through the first (simplified) approach, the finite elements model has been used to estimate the temperature distribution inside the reactor during the experimental tests. An average (experimental) torrefaction temperature has been then calculated and used as input of the kinetic model. In the second approach, the proposed kinetic scheme has been implemented directly in the f.v.m. model, solving numerically the mass and energy conservation equation. The results obtained by means of the two modelling approaches have been then compared with the experimental data. The proposed thermochemical and fluid dynamic model seems to be a suitable tool for the simulation of a torrefaction reactor and useful for the characterisation and optimization of such kind of systems.},

	abstract = {In enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), the natural permeability of deep rocks is normally not high enough and needs to be increased. Permeability increase can be achieved through various stimulation methods, such as hydraulic, chemical, and thermal stimulation. Among these, hydraulic stimulation is the most commonly used technique to increase both reservoir permeability and the specific area for heat exchange. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes towards an optimization of hydraulic stimulation performance while minimizing the potential of unwanted induced seismicity is a critical prerequisite for a successful development of any EGS site. In this paper, we review the hydraulic stimulation strategies that have been developed and implemented for EGS. We begin with a description of the underlying mechanisms through which the permeability and heat exchange area increases are achieved. We then discuss the mechanisms of fluid injection-induced seismicity during and after a hydraulic stimulation operation. After that, alternative hydraulic stimulation strategies, namely conventional hydraulic stimulation, multi-stage fracturing, and cyclic soft stimulation, are reviewed based on current research in theoretical studies as well as, laboratory, and in-situ field experiments. Finally, some representative EGS projects are reviewed, focusing on fluid injection strategies, seismic responses, and reservoir permeability enhancement performance. The review shows the importance and need of (a) a comprehensive geological characterization of the natural fracture system including the nearby fault zones as well as the in-situ stress conditions, prior to the development of the site, (b) a proper design of the well arrangement, such as the positioning of the injection and production wells, and (c) the selection of an appropriate fluid injection strategy for the system at hand.},

	abstract = {We describe a 3-D discrete fracture hybrid model (DFHM) that returns forecasts of both induced seismicity and of power generation in an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS). Our model considers pore-pressure increase as the mechanism driving induced seismicity, similarly to other hybrid models, but it uses discrete fracture modelling for flow and heat that allows accurate and realistic transient solutions of pore pressure and temperature in fractured reservoirs. Earthquakes and flow are thus considered as closely coupled processes. In the DFHM model, the creation phase of an EGS is described as a Markovian process with a transitional probability that encapsulates the irreducible uncertainty with regards to induced seismicity. We conditioned this transitional probability on field observations from the 2006 EGS project in Basel, achieving a good match with observations of seismicity evolution. Specifically, our model effectively reproduces and explains the observed long-term exponential decay of seismicity after the well was shut in, suggesting that pore pressure diffusion in a critically stressed fractured reservoir is sufficient to explain long-lasting post-injection seismic activity as observed in Basel. We then investigate alternative injection scenarios, using Monte Carlo simulations to capture the uncertainties in fault locations and stressing conditions. We show that the number of induced events depends not only on the total injected volume but also on the injection strategy. We demonstrate that multistage injection schemes are superior to single-stage ones, since the former are associated with less seismic risk and can generate at least the same revenue in the long term.},

	abstract = {Both field injectivity and induced seismicity were reported to be inversely correlated with the temperature of re-injected fluids at the Hellisheiði geothermal field in Iceland. This observation has led to a hypothesis that transient cooling-induced permeability enhancement is a novel mechanism for induced seismicity, in addition to elevated fluid pressure, poroelastic stressing, and thermoelastic stressing in geothermal environments. In this work, a 3D calibrated coupled THM model was developed to model the colder fluids re-injection process over a 1-year period and evaluate the potential for induced seismicity in terms of Coulomb stress changes at the Hellisheiði geothermal field. Three modelling scenarios taking into account respectively the poroelastic effect, thermoporoelastic effect, and thermoporoelastic effect with permeability enhancement, were examined and compared to identify the dominant mechanism for the recorded seismicity and examine the contribution from each individual mechanism. Results have shown that, under normal fluid re-injection pressure and temperature conditions, the permeability enhancement effect is the dominant mechanism for induced seismicity at the Hellisheiði geothermal field. Specifically, the contribution to Coulomb stress changes from the permeability enhancement effect is almost twice of that from the thermoelastic stressing, which is in turn two orders of magnitude larger than that from the poroelastic stressing. It has also been noted that, when reducing temperature of re-injected fluids from 120°C to 20°C, the temperature change is increased by 2.1 times at 1,000 m depth, while the amount of mass flow by around 4 times. Thus, the amount of heat transferred can be increased 8.4 times by lowering temperature of the injected fluids, which explains the high sensitivity of induced seismicity to temperature. Outcomes of this work suggest temperature control of injected fluids as a feasible regulation method to mitigate against injection-induced seismic risk in geothermal reservoirs.},

Simulation results show that the faults located in the vicinity of the injection well fail during injection mainly triggered by pore pressure buildup. Poroelastic stressing, which may be stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the fault orientation, reaches further than pressure diffusion, having a greater effect on distant faults. After injection stops, poroelastic stress relaxation leads to the immediate rupture of previously stabilized faults. Shear-slip stress transfer, which also contributes to post-injection reactivation of distant faults, is enhanced in faults with slip-induced friction weakening.},

	abstract = {The basic triggering mechanism underlying induced seismicity traces back to the mid-1960s that relied on the process of pore-fluid pressure diffusion. The last decade has experienced a renaissance of induced seismicity research and data proliferation. An unprecedent opportunity is presented to us to synthesize the robust growth in knowledge. The objective of this article is to provide a concise review of the triggering mechanisms of induced earthquakes with a focus on hydro-mechanical processes. Four mechanisms are reviewed: pore-fluid pressure diffusion, poroelastic stress, Coulomb static stress transfer, and aseismic slip. For each, an introduction of the concept is presented, followed by case studies. Diving into these mechanisms sheds light on several outstanding questions. For example, why did some earthquakes occur far from fluid injection or after injection stopped? Our review converges on the following conclusions: (a) Pore-fluid pressure diffusion remains a basic mechanism for initiating inducing seismicity in the near-field. (b) Poroelastic stresses and aseismic slip play an important role in inducing seismicity in regions beyond the influence of pore-fluid pressure diffusion. (c) Coulomb static stress transfer from earlier seismicity is shown to be a viable mechanism for increasing stresses on mainshock faults. (d) Multiple mechanisms have operated concurrently or consecutively at most induced seismicity sites. (e) Carbon dioxide injection is succeeding without inducing earthquakes and much can be learned from its success. Future research opportunities exist in deepening the understanding of physical and chemical processes in the nexus of geoenergy development and fluid motion in the Earth’s crust.},

This issue is of concern to local and indigenous communities, regulatory bodies, operators and their insurers, as it poses risks to health, safety, and project economics and success. To assess the likelihood and potential magnitude (i.e., severity) of fluid-injection-induced seismicity events, empirical relationships for natural earthquakes have been co-opted that relate event size distributions (b-value) to focal mechanisms and inferred in-situ stress regimes. However, it remains unclear whether these associations can be generalized and applied to fluid-injection- induced seismicity. Analyses presented here using a global dataset of induced seismicity events suggest they can't. Unlike natural earthquakes where tectonic forces generally activate the faults most critically aligned to the far-field in-situ stresses, fluid-injection-induced seismicity is driven mainly by localized pressure perturbations that may activate a fault with a non-critically aligned orientation. These findings are further investigated and supported using 3-D Mohr-circle slip tendency analyses and 3-D numerical models employing a fully-coupled hydro-mechanical bonded-lattice methodology via the commercial hydraulic fracturing numerical simulation program XSite. The combined empirical, analytical and numerical simulation results indicate that under a transform stress regime (SH {\textgreater} SV {\textgreater} Sh), for typical reservoir depths (i.e., 1–6 km), a larger area of the fault affected by the injected fluid pressures is critically stressed compared to a compressional stress regime (SH {\textgreater} Sh {\textgreater} SV), resulting in a larger slip area and an increased likelihood of larger magnitude fluid-injection-induced seismicity events. These findings have important implications for the development of effective hazard mitigation strategies and risk management protocols for fluid-injection-induced seismicity.},

The results reveal that the perforation can substantially influence hydraulic fracture initiation and extension. The vertically-oriented-perforation induced fracture will effectively initiate with moderate near-wellbore complexity, promoting fracture crossing at bedding interfaces. The interlaced design of perforation cluster can alleviate the stress shadow effect and facilitate uniform fracture propagation. The far-field fracture complexity are related to the bedding interfacial properties: more tensile interfaces tend to arrest induced fractures and restrict their vertical growth, while more fracturing fluid will be diverted into the permeable interfaces of lower shear strength. The complex fracture networks has the potential to trigger fault reactivation or serve as conduits for underground water, thus causing induce seismicity or aquifer contamination. The findings can enrich the understanding of multi-scale fluid-solid coupling mechanisms and further help us prevent geological hazards.},

The present study succinctly reviews more than a hundred scientific papers that have deeply explored hydraulic fracture propagation from the rock mechanical perspective and summarizes the current state of knowledge on the propagation of hydraulic fractures. These studies fall into three major categories of field, experimental, and numerical studies. It was found that numerical simulations are the most common methods for studying hydraulic fracture propagation, while field and analytical studies are the least-used methods because of their technical complications and practical limitations. One of the most efficient methods for the numerical simulation that has been adopted by numerous researches from around the world in recent years is the Lattice simulation approach. This method is a particle-based model and uses the Distinct Element Method. Since the Lattice simulation presents higher accuracy and computational efficiency over the existing methods to simulate complex reservoir conditions, the current review particularly focuses on this method and also discusses the functionality of the recently introduced XSite simulation package. The results from this work demonstrate the superior ability of the Lattice simulation and XSite package in modeling different propagation regimes, geometry, and growth of the HF. Moreover, the authors simulated the interaction mode of hydraulic and natural fractures based on two significant parameters of the phenomenon, namely “angle of approach” and “in situ differential stress”, and verified the results with the Blanton criteria.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT:. A large number of previous research has been done on characterization, hydraulic fracturing treatments, and well completion design. However, few studies have been conducted on the simulation of hydraulic fracture propagation, especially when the formation is heterogeneous and with large number of natural fractures. The existence of natural fractures at different scales may affect the propagation of the induced fracture. The crossing, arresting and opening are the interaction modes that are observed. The use of the discrete fracture network (DFN) models have been widespread in recent years in unconventional reservoir applications. In this paper, the microseismic monitoring is used to represent the stimulated reservior vloume (SRV), to indicate the relation between stress anisotropy and microseismic cloud shape. Xsite, a new, lattice-based software was used in an initial attempt towards understanding how the rock mass and the pre-existing natural fractures response to fluid injection is affected by some of the DFN characteries and operational parameters. Results indicated that for a given injected volume, a low stress anisotropy results in wide fracture fairway geometry whereas narrow fairway is observed as stress anisotropy is increased. Also, it was observed that the oirentation of the natural fracture network with respect to the principal stresses play an important role in fracture propagation.},

	abstract = {In Utah FORGE reservoir, eight pressure transient tests (microhydraulic fracturing and DFIT™) show natural fracture/pressure-dependent leakoff. This behavior may lead to misinterpretation of the closure pressure (proxy for minimum principal stress). The closure pressures obtained from DFIT™ (or microhydraulic fracturing) testing may reflect shear failure along natural fractures or discontinuities rather than tensile failure and lead to inaccurate estimates of the minimum principal stress. In pressure tests conducted at the Utah FORGE site showed that reactivation or opening of natural fractures intersecting the wellbore and were suggested by multiple closure events in DFIT™ tests. In addition, comparisons between the pre- and post-well-tests FMI logs show that there are populations of induced fracture and reactivated natural fractures which are mostly vertical and sub-vertical. In this study, DFIT™ (or microhydraulic fracturing) test analysis and numerical simulations were used to suggest that hydraulic shearing of critically stressed natural fractures can contribute to multiple closure signatures and possibly lead to incorrect determination of the minimum principal stress. As other authors have previously advocated, the DFIT™ test analyses and numerical simulations suggest that better estimations of minimum principal stress may be derived by injecting at relatively high rate and pressure and insuring that tensile breakdown is reached. In addition, extended shut-in period is required to determine accurate reservoir characteristics and fluid flow regime.},

In this context, energy geo-storage provides various alternatives, the use of which depends on the quality of surplus energy. In terms of power and energy capacity, large mechanical energy storage systems such as Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) are cost-effective and suitable for centralized power generation. In contrast, sensible and latent heat storage are appropriate for distributed applications when excess heat is involved. Energy density estimations highlight the advantages of compressed air over elevated water, and latent heat over sensible heat storage. From a geotechnical standpoint, the operation of geo-storage systems exerts complex effective stress, temperature, wet-dry, and freeze-thaw cycles. Although these excitations may not cause monotonic failure, they lead to ratcheting or shakedown behavior, both of which must be carefully analyzed to ensure the proper long-term cyclic response of energy geo-storage systems.},

	abstract = {The increasing integration of renewable energies in the electricity grid is expected to contribute considerably towards the European Union goals of energy and GHG emissions reduction. However, it also brings new challenges for the grid. Large-scale energy storage can provide means for a better integration of renewable energy sources, balancing supply and demand, increasing energy security, enhancing a better management of the grid and also allowing convergence towards a low carbon economy. One way to ensure large-scale energy storage is to use the storage capacity in underground reservoirs, since geological formations have the potential to store large volumes of fluids with minimal impact to environment and society. There are several technologies which can be viable options for underground energy storage, as well as several types of underground reservoirs can be considered. The underground energy storage technologies for renewable energy integration addressed in this article are: Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES); Underground Pumped Hydro Storage (UPHS); Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES); Underground Gas Storage (UGS) and Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS), both connected to Power-to-gas (P2G) systems. For these different types of underground energy storage technologies there are several suitable geological reservoirs, namely: depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, porous aquifers, salt formations, engineered rock caverns in host rocks and abandoned mines. Specific site screening criteria are applicable to each of these reservoir types and technologies, determining the viability of the reservoir itself, and of the technology for that site. This paper presents a review of the criteria applied to identify suitable technology-reservoir couples.},

A new mechanical model is developed for lens behavior during flowback (production), shut-in, and inflation (storage) stages. The model couples elastic deformation of the lens with Darcy–Weisbach fluid flow spanning the laminar to turbulent regimes. It includes an energy-based inlet boundary condition governing fluid flow rate out of the lens and up to the Earth's surface. It also introduces pressure-dependent leakoff of fluid to the surrounding rock and the impact of intact rock bridges, which can arise from the lens having multiple petals or lobes, on lens compliance. The model is then used to illustrate the transition from early-time gradual decline in wellhead pressure and flow rate to eventual pinching of the lens width at the wellbore, leading to rapid decline of pressure and flow rate. The model demonstrates the feasibility of efficient storage cycles that generate a desired amount of power over a desired time while avoiding pinching. Maximizing efficiency is shown to have at least two contrasting regimes depending on whether the fluid leakoff rate to the host rock is dependent on the fluid pressure. The development of this model is therefore an essential step in deployment of subsurface energy storage by providing a mechanical basis for storage lens design.},

            A significant effort is focused on developing cost-effective long-duration energy storage for integrating and expanding the use of renewable energy resources. Geo-mechanical pumped Storage (GPS) leverages the natural energy storage capability of subsurface formations to store water under pressure. The approach is in a way similar to oil and gas production with the potential to leverage an already established supply chain for drilling, reservoir formation, and production. However, with the proposed approach, the head and flow requirement to charge and discharge the subsurface reservoir changes, needing the pumps and turbines with high head flow conditions. The current study explores the design space for the development of turbines and pumps for GPS systems with a focus on expanding the pump as a Turbine option in line with the overall vision of achieving the lowest possible Levelized Cost of Storage Energy (LCOSE). Initial installations focus on two 1 MW systems (522.4 m3/hr and 1044 m3/hr). Design space includes single and multi-stage options at different rotational speeds to optimize the roundtrip efficiency and Net Positive Suction Head-requirements (NPSHr) for surface-installed equipment. Design iterations investigate the rotor-stator interactions, flow slip in reversible direction, and means to optimize the outlet performance to minimize the cavitation occurrence. The analysis lays out different configurations and concludes with the discussion about proposed design that outputs a round trip efficiency of 74\% with a path to minimize manufacturing and assembly cost for different installations using modular configurations.},

            The geo-mechanical hydro-storage method utilizes the natural energy storage capability of subsurface formations to store water under pressure. The pumps supply water underground and store it in-between layers of low permeability formations. The natural elasticity of the rock holds the water under pressure. The pressurized water is released through a turbine to produce electricity to send back to the grid. The proven capability to cycle hydraulic power across a broad range of geographies for long duration energy storage makes this method attractive. However, with the proposed pumped storage concept, the storage capacity and head availability requirements change as compared to conventional hydro storage facilities due to specific limitations with well-size (flow rate) and underground formation. The current study focuses on exploring different pump and turbine options for the given operating conditions and developing a way forward to qualify the pump and turbine for specific operational conditions based on cost, performance, and reliability. Pump options include centrifugal and plunger pumps, while turbine options include Pelton and Francis or Centrifugal Pump as Turbine. Three configurations are proposed based on initial cost and round-trip efficiency values. A metric Levelized Cost of Stored Energy (LCOSE) is utilized to compare the performance of different options, considering 25 years of overall life span. A sensitivity study was applied to chosen configurations and sizes for different roundtrip efficiencies and projected initial costs. Within given bounds, operational conditions, and assumptions made, the study outputs Pump-as-Turbine (PaT) as an optimal solution for the proposed conditions.},

	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/889392},
	abstract = {Field measurements and modeling have shown the potential for using a Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal reservoir for electric load following: either with Power-Peaking from a base-load operating condition, or for Pumped Storage of off-peak electric energy with a very significant thermal augmentation of the stored mechanical energy during periods of power production. For the base-load with power-peaking mode of operation, an HDR reservoir appears capable of producing over twice its nominal power output for short--2 to 4 hour--periods of time. In this mode of operation, the reservoir normally would be produced under a high-backpressure condition with the HDR reservoir region near the production well highly inflated. Upon demand, the production backpressure would be sharply reduced, surging the production flow. Alternatively, for Pumped Storage, the reservoir would be operated in a cyclic mode, with production shut-in during off-peak hours. When the produced thermal energy of such a pumped-storage system is considered, an HDR reservoir would be capable of returning considerably more energy to the surface during the production phase than would have been consumed in inflating the reservoir during the off-peak storage phase. Pumped Storage reservoir operation was actually demonstrated experimentally during a brief series of cyclic reservoir tests at the end of the Long-Term Flow Test (LTFT) of the HDR reservoir at Fenton Hill, NM in May 1993. The analytical tool used in these investigations has been the transient finite element model of the an HDR reservoir called GEOCRACK, which is being developed by Professor Dan Swenson and his students at Kansas State University. This discrete-element representation of a jointed rock mass has recently been validated for transient operations using the set of cyclic reservoir operating data obtained at the end of the LTFT.},

The temperature of mine water is a useful parameter, coupled with depth to water, sustainable yield and recharge potential, to identify suitable locations and calculate the likely performance of heat recovery schemes. This paper aims to provide the first mapping and synthesis of the temperature of Britain's coalfields to support this emerging technology. Using the best available evidence, a median geothermal gradient of 24.1°C km−1 was calculated for the British coalfields. However, geothermal gradients between separate coalfields can vary from 17.3 to 34.3°C km−1. The North East, Cumbria and Yorkshire coalfields all have mean geothermal gradients generally {\textgreater}30°C km−1, whereas geothermal gradients of generally {\textless}23°C km−1 are measured in the Warwickshire, South Wales, Staffordshire, Douglas and Fife coalfields. Active dewatering schemes are shown to locally increase the apparent measured geothermal gradient by ingress and mixing of deeper water into the pumping shafts. This baseline spatial mapping and synthesis of coalfield temperatures offers significant benefit to those planning, designing and regulating heat recovery and storage in Britain's abandoned coalfields.},

Now, its potential as a renewable source of energy is being recognised increasingly, and technologies and concepts for exploiting it are developing rapidly along two lines: low enthalpy (low temperature) resources, which exploit warm water in the shallow subsurface to provide heat either directly (as warm water) or indirectly (via heat exchange systems); and high enthalpy (high temperature) resources, which yield hot water, usually from deeper levels, that can be used to generate electricity.
The potential for harnessing electricity from geothermal energy has long been recognised; the potentially substantial reserves, minimal environmental impact, and capacity to contribute continuously to base load electricity supply make it an extremely attractive prospect. The ongoing drive to develop renewable sources of energy, coupled with anticipated technological developments that will in future reduce the depth at which heat reservoirs are considered economically viable, means there is now a pressing need to know more about the deep geothermal energy potential in Scotland. This report contains the British Geological Survey (BGS) contribution to a collaborative project between AECOM and BGS to produce a qualitative assessment of deep geothermal energy potential in onshore Scotland for the Scottish Government. BGS‘s role is to provide the Stage One deliverable ―Identifying and assessing geothermal energy potential‖, comprising an assessment of areas in Scotland most likely to hold deep geothermal resources based on existing geological and geothermal data sets.
The report is divided into two parts. Part 1 sets out the background to geothermal energy, describes the geological context, and presents an analysis of the size and accessibility of the heat resource in Scotland based on existing geothermal data. The potential for exploiting deep geothermal energy in three settings in inshore areas of Scotland (abandoned mine workings, Hot Sedimentary Aquifers, and Hot Dry Rocks) is examined in Part 2.},

This unique energy application with mine water in the U.S., however, has not been reported. This study reports on a real geothermal energy application in the U.S. for the use of water in flooded mines for house heating. First, the site exploration of a typical flooded copper mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is presented to discuss three essential components of the proposed large-scale energy application, i.e., bedrock geology, mining background, and energy reserve analyses. Then, the key technical details and data monitoring of a demonstration project for the use of mine water for heating a 15,000 ft2 (1394 m2) building are introduced. For the energy reserve, energy reserve analyses were conducted considering the renewability of the thermal energy in the natural system, which was usually neglected in the literature. The analyses revealed that the annual extractable energy from the explored flooded mine with the energy replenishment is comparable to the annual energy generated by a small-scale power station, which can support over 82,000 households. The results from the demonstration project indicated that house heating with geothermal energy via the mine water is the most efficient and the second most economical heating option in very unfavorable conditions with a high electricity price and a low annual average air temperature. The intention of this study is to share the background and practical knowledge that has been learned from this ongoing project to guide future real installations in other mining areas with deep flooded mines in the U.S. and around the world.},

	abstract = {Based on 44 documented demonstration projects worldwide, a novel conceptual aspect of mine-oriented low-enthalpy geothermal exploitation classification was initially proposed. For this new classification, special attention was paid to a spatio-temporal perspective. From the first temporal perspective, i.e. life-cycle of a mine, the projects implemented in mine legacy phase are dominated (55\%), followed by production stage (36\%). From the second space point of view, the low-enthalpy geothermal heat, i.e. {\textasciitilde}{\textless}2000 m depth within the Earth’s Critical Zone (corresponding to the earth temperature {\textless} 85 °C), can be recoverd using different geothermal media such as solid-mine rock stratum (7\%), liquid-mine water (79\%) and gas-mine ventilation exhaust (14\%) in open pits and/or underground mines. Next, several engineering issues were discussed, including configurations, parameters, hydro-thermo-geological conditions etc., to analyze their effects on the performance and sustainability of dominated mine water-based geothermal systems. Another key outcome of this review is to apply three methods: theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental test, on mine water-based scenario to acquire the current status of the feasibility study. Moreover, an analytical conceptual model, mainly focusing on the structural characteristics of long-wall coal mining gobs, shafts and galleries, was developed to preliminarily evaluate the static and dynamic geothermal potential of flooded Jiahe colliery with the traditional volume method. It is hoped that the findings, viewpoints and suggestions obtained from this review can be served as references for real geothermal installations associated with mine sites in the future.},

	url = {https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/41046},
	doi = {10.7488/era/3785},
	abstract = {The drive for net zero requires alternative, renewable heat sources and storage solutions to transition away from traditional gas heating. Decarbonisation of the heating sector is more complex than for electricity and heating accounts for around 50\% of energy use in the UK. Therefore, a number of different options are required to fulfil the UK government’s Net Zero Strategy. 

The use of abandoned mines as a heat source and store has been receiving increased attention. It is a favourable option due to the proximity of mines to population centres and their higher temperatures and permeabilities relative to standard shallow aquifer geothermal heat sources. However, there are several risk factors in the development of mine water heat schemes, one of which is the potential for stability issues due to injecting and extracting heat from shallow abandoned coal workings. 

The hydraulic, thermal and geomechanical processes governing heat storage and extraction are complex. Understanding these processes is critical to safe heat extraction and injection into mine water systems which have undergone anthropogenically induced changes such as dewatering. One key knowledge gap in the development of mine water heating and cooling systems is what impact they could have on existing mine infrastructure in general and on the stability of the whole mine system in particular. In order to address this gap, this thesis outlines the development of a fully coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical model representing shallow abandoned flooded coal mine workings to gain an understanding of the key controlling processes in mine water heating and cooling systems.

The first stage of model development was a fully saturated 2D model simulating mine water rebound in Midlothian, Scotland. The modelled surface uplift to water level rise ratio of 1.4mm/m is of the same order of magnitude as that observed through InSAR data in the coalfield due to mine water rebound. This shows that the model created has suitable fidelity for identification of the key governing processes. 

To improve the applicability of the model, thermal processes were added to further understand the key underlying controlling mechanisms. This second stage model focussed on one layer of room and pillar workings. A methodology to determine mechanical stability was also developed to understand the relative importance of different parameters and scenarios on the model results. 
It was found that the cyclical injection and extraction of heat does have an impact on both the modelled displacements and mechanical stability of the system. Due to the assumptions in the model and the fact it is an initial attempt to construct a THM model of these systems, the absolute values are of less importance than the relative impacts, i.e. the model is a useful research tool for process comparison. 

In a mine water heat system, the components that can be controlled operationally, i.e. the injection temperature and the water level changes, have more of an impact than the underlying geological conditions. This is highly significant because it means that the future location of mine water heating schemes should take into consideration the likely scale of water level changes. Equally significant, the risk of impact reduces with temperature, so shallow systems with a low temperature change are likely to be less risky than those with higher temperature and pressure changes. 
The results suggest that mine water heat scheme regulations could include threshold values for temperature and water level changes which would require an additional stability assessment of the system. It is important to characterise the rock properties at a specific site, particularly whether the surrounding rocks are hard or soft, to understand how the stresses are likely to transfer and whether they will build up around the workings. 
Consideration should also be given the injection of colder water as a way to manage the build-up of thermal stresses over time. Modelling shows that thermally balanced systems are preferable to exclusive heat injection in managing mechanical stability over time. 

In conclusion, this research has successfully developed a methodology for assessing the controlling processes in mine water heat injection and extraction. In so doing, it has provided initial input into one of the key knowledge gaps on the geomechanical stability of these systems, with the ultimate aim of contributing to a better informed regulatory framework around shallow mine water heat schemes in both the UK and beyond.},

The extensive cavities created after extraction of ores/coal in mines could provide a unique opportunity for storage and extraction of thermal energy. This paper shows that underground backfilled stopes present a viable potential for being retrofitted to thermal energy storage batteries. The present study evaluates the energy performance of thermal energy storage in underground backfilled stopes by installing heat exchange tubes prior to backfill placement. A numerical fluid mechanics and heat transfer model for backfill stopes was developed in Fluent to investigate the heat exchange inside the tubes as well as the heat transfer happening within the backfill during the heat storage and extraction process. The proposed model is compared against an analytical heat transfer model to determine its reliability and accuracy. The results obtained from the validated numerical model showed that energy storage system in a typical underground backfilled stope of coal mines can provide about 23 GWh of thermal energy storage capacity with an average recovery rate of 60\% during extraction cycles. Accordingly, several sensitivity analyses were conducted to define the optimum center-to-center distance for the pipe installation to attain the best system performance. Through a series of parametric studies, it was found that thermal conductivity of backfill and rock, circulating fluid mass flow rate, initial rock temperature and thermal saturation time constitute the most significant influencing parameters on energy storage performance of such applications. It can be concluded that thermal energy storage systems in backfilled stopes are relatively more techno-economically feasible, compared to conventional borehole energy storage systems, in terms of their significantly lower drilling/installation costs and higher hosting temperature.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Mines are heavy energy consumers and energy costs are significantly high for remote mines located far from the grid, due to considerable spending on fuel and fuel transportation. The mining industry is also increasingly aware of the need to shift towards cleaner energy sources in order to reduce its environmental impact. As a reliable source, capable of delivering very high availability factors, geothermal is an important, though often overlooked, energy option for the mining industry. For mines that are located in areas of high geothermal potential, geothermal energy can provide for parts of a mining operation’s electrical power needs. Geothermal fluids are utilized in a variety of ways during the operational life cycle of a mine. In the production stage, hot fluids are used directly in applications such as raffinate heating in copper production and enhanced heap leaching for the extraction of gold and silver. Underground mines in areas of high geothermal potential must deal with higher ventilation loads; these can be partially provided for by in-situ geothermal power generation. Geothermal fluids can also provide energy for space heating, typically a substantial load for northern mines. In the closure and post-closure phases of a project, hot water irrigation can enhance reclamation rates, while an operating power plant that is turned over to the local community results in jobs creation, and can support community development through projects such as geothermal district heating. In addition, geothermal energy helps reduce a mine’s environmental impact and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and improves its reputation within local communities, while “greening” its portfolio and contributing to sustainable development and the process of acquiring and retaining a social license to operate. The main factors affecting the successful integration of geothermal energy in a mining development are: the presence of a proven, accessible, and extractable resource; the relative price of alternate energy options; the distance from/to the grid; the potential for coproduction and/or minerals extraction; and the availability of communities and other industries in the vicinity of the mine. This paper outlines the synergies between mining and geothermal energy, and explores the ways in which geothermal energy can contribute to the development and operation of a mine.},

In Glasgow, UK, a subsurface observatory has been constructed for mine water heat and heat storage research. We synthesize geological and mine water resource findings from a 4 year period of borehole planning, drilling, logging and testing. The heterogeneous bedrock is typical of the Scottish Coal Measures Group, whereas superficial deposits are more sand- and gravel-dominated than predicted. Mine water boreholes encountered workings in the Glasgow Upper, Glasgow Ell and Glasgow Main coal seams, proving water-filled voids, mine waste, fractured rock mass and intact coal pillars, with high yields on initial hydrogeological testing. Although the depth and extent of mine workings delineated on mine abandonment plans proved accurate, metre-scale variability was expected and proved in the boreholes. A mine water reservoir classification established from the observatory boreholes highlights the resource potential in areas of total extraction, stowage, and stoop and room workings. Because their spatial extent is more extensive across the UK than shafts or roadways, increasing the mine water energy evidence base and reducing exploration risk in these types of legacy workings is important.Supplementary material: Borehole reports and other datasets are available at https://ukgeos.ac.uk/data-downloads (mixture of over 20 DOI datasets and reports or data packs published openly on https://nora.nerc.ac.uk; all material is deposited in the National Geoscience Data Centre).},

	abstract = {As part of the new French law on energy transition, the Demosthene research project is studying the possibility of reusing old abandoned mines to store thermal energy in the Picardy region. The aim is to store the heat required for a small collective unit, which corresponds to a volume of water of 2000–8000 m3, depending on the temperature (from 15 to 70 °C). An inventory shows around 3700 theoretically available sites in this region. These are mostly shallow dry mines, or mines that are partially flooded with around 1 m of water depth. Based on this water depth and an extraction ratio of 75\%, the required mine area is approximately 10,000 m2. From the 40 sites that have a sufficient surface area, only 1 is naturally flooded, although statistically many others will exist that are currently not known. For this experimental site to be reproducible, the decision was made to select dry mines but with a sufficient area to achieve an artificial flooding device. Theoretically, this represents more than a thousand sites in Picardy. The most interesting one is the old limestone mine of Saint-Maximin, where a sealed basin can be built. Before installing an experimental underground thermal energy storage basin in this site, the thermomechanical and hydrothermal behaviors were modeled. The aim was to optimize the position of the various sensors that will be used to monitor the basin, and to predict the future deformations induced on the walls by the thermal variations. A 100-m3 basin, sealed with a liner, was built and fitted with 18 sensors to measure temperature, humidity and strain. These sensors allow the stored water, the rock walls and the surrounding atmosphere to be monitored. This device must now operate for 6 months, i.e. a complete heating–cooling cycle, and its results will be analyzed.},

	abstract = {Studies of the former NE England coalfield in Tyneside demonstrated that heat flow perturbations in boreholes were due to the entrainment and lateral dispersion of heat from deeper in the subsurface through flooded mine workings. This work assesses the influence of historical mining on geothermal observations across Greater Glasgow. The regional heat flow for Glasgow is 60 mW m−2 and, after correction for palaeoclimate, is estimated as c. 80 mW m−2. An example of reduced heat flow above mine workings is observed at Hallside (c. 10 km SE of Glasgow), where the heat flow through a 352 m deep borehole is c. 14 mW m−2. Similarly, the heat flow across the 199 m deep GGC01 borehole in the Glasgow Geothermal Energy Research Field Site is c. 44 mW m−2. The differences between these values and the expected regional heat flow suggest a significant component of horizontal heat flow into surrounding flooded mine workings. This deduction also influences the quantification of deeper geothermal resources, as extrapolation of the temperature gradient above mine workings would underestimate the temperature at depth. Future projects should consider the influence of historical mining on heat flow when temperature datasets such as these are used in the design of geothermal developments.Supplementary material: Background information on the chronology of historical mining at each borehole location and a summary of groundwater flow in mine workings beneath Glasgow are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4681100Thematic collection: This article is part of the ‘Early Career Research’ available at: https://www.lyellcollection.org/cc/SJG-early-career-research},

	abstract = {We present a new Integrated Finite Element Neural Network framework (I-FENN), with the objective to accelerate the numerical solution of nonlinear computational mechanics problems. We leverage the swift predictive capability of neural networks (NNs) and we embed them inside the finite element stiffness function, to compute element-level state variables and their derivatives within a nonlinear, iterative numerical solution. This process is conducted jointly with conventional finite element methods that involve shape functions: the NN receives input data that resembles the material point deformation and its output is used to construct element-level field variables such as the element Jacobian matrix and residual vector. Here we introduce I-FENN to the continuum damage analysis of quasi-brittle materials, and we establish a new non-local gradient-based damage framework which operates at the cost of a local damage approach. First, we develop a physics informed neural network (PINN) to resemble the non-local gradient model and then we train the neural network offline. The network learns to predict the non-local equivalent strain at each material point, as well as its derivative with respect to the local strain. Then, the PINN is integrated in the element stiffness definition and conducts the local to non-local strain transformation, whereas the two PINN outputs are used to construct the element Jacobian matrix and residual vector. This process is carried out within the nonlinear solver, until numerical convergence is achieved. The resulting method bears the computational cost of the conventional local damage approach, but ensures mesh-independent results and a diffused non-local strain and damage profile. As a result, the proposed method tackles the vital drawbacks of both the local and non-local gradient method, respectively being the mesh-dependence and additional computational cost. We showcase through a series of numerical examples the computational efficiency and generalization capability of I-FENN in the context of non-local continuum damage, and we discuss the future outlook. The PINN training code and associated training data files have been made publicly available online, to enable reproducibility of our results.},

	abstract = {Most currently available methods for modeling multiphysics, including thermoelasticity, using machine learning approaches, are focused on solving complete multiphysics problems using data-driven or physics-informed multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks. Such models rely on incremental step-wise training of the MLPs, and lead to elevated computational expense; they also lack the rigor of existing numerical methods like the finite element method. We propose an integrated finite element neural network (I-FENN) framework to expedite the solution of coupled transient thermoelasticity. A novel physics-informed temporal convolutional network (PI-TCN) is developed and embedded within the finite element framework to leverage the fast inference of neural networks (NNs). The PI-TCN model captures some of the fields in the multiphysics problem; then, the network output is used to compute the other fields of interest using the finite element method. We establish a framework that computationally decouples the energy equation from the linear momentum equation. We first develop a PI-TCN model to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the temperature field across the simulation time based on the energy equation and strain data. The PI-TCN model is integrated into the finite element framework, where the PI-TCN output (temperature) is used to introduce the temperature effect to the linear momentum equation. The finite element problem is solved using the implicit Euler time discretization scheme, resulting in a computational cost comparable to that of a weakly-coupled thermoelasticity problem but with the ability to solve fully-coupled problems. Finally, we demonstrate I-FENN’s computational efficiency and generalization capability in thermoelasticity through several numerical examples.},

	abstract = {The use of abandoned mines as a heat source and store has been receiving increased attention as a renewable heat source and storage solution in the transition away from traditional gas heating. The hydraulic, thermal and geomechanical processes governing heat storage and extraction are complex and understanding these processes is critical to safe heat extraction and injection into mine water systems. This paper outlines the development of a fully coupled thermo-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) 2D model to understand the mechanical stability of room and pillar workings during heat injection and extraction. It was found that the cyclical injection and extraction of heat does have an impact on both the modelled displacements and mechanical stability of the system. The impact risk reduces with temperature and the operational processes (e.g. injection temperature and water level) have more of an impact than the underlying geological conditions. These results are significant and could be included in a regulatory system to reduce the likelihood of stability impacts in mine water heating and cooling schemes.

These results shed light on recent advances in computer vision and graphics that achieve state-of-the-art results by using MLPs to represent complex 3D objects and scenes. Using tools from the neural tangent kernel (NTK) literature, we show that a standard MLP has impractically slow convergence to high frequency signal components. To overcome this spectral bias, we use a Fourier feature mapping to transform the effective NTK into a stationary kernel with a tunable bandwidth. We suggest an approach for selecting problem-specific Fourier features that greatly improves the performance of MLPs for low-dimensional regression tasks relevant to the computer vision and graphics communities.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are demonstrating remarkable promise in integrating physical models with gappy and noisy observational data, but they still struggle in cases where the target functions to be approximated exhibit high-frequency or multi-scale features. In this work we investigate this limitation through the lens of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and elucidate how PINNs are biased towards learning functions along the dominant eigen-directions of their limiting NTK. Using this observation, we construct novel architectures that employ spatio-temporal and multi-scale random Fourier features, and justify how such coordinate embedding layers can lead to robust and accurate PINN models. Numerical examples are presented for several challenging cases where conventional PINN models fail, including wave propagation and reaction–diffusion dynamics, illustrating how the proposed methods can be used to effectively tackle both forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations with multi-scale behavior.

	abstract = {The deep energy method (DEM), a type of physics-informed neural network, is evolving as an alternative to finite element analysis. It employs the principle of minimum potential energy to predict an object’s behavior under various boundary conditions. However, the model’s accuracy is contingent upon choosing the appropriate architecture for the model, which can be challenging due to the high interactions between hyperparameters, large search space, difficulty in identifying objective functions, and non-convex relationships with the objective functions. To improve DEM’s accuracy, we first introduce random Fourier feature (RFF) mapping. RFF mapping helps during the model’s training by reducing bias toward high frequencies. The effects of six hyperparameters are then studied under static compression, tension, and bending loads in planar linear elasticity. Based on this study, a systematic automated hyperparameter optimization approach is proposed. Due to the high interaction between hyperparameters and the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, Bayesian optimization algorithms are used. The models trained using optimized hyperparameters and having Fourier feature mapping can accurately predict deflections compared to finite element analysis. Additionally, the deflections obtained for tension and compression load cases are more sensitive to variations in hyperparameters than bending.},

This paper presents a machine learning (ML) framework for the prediction of the stress-strain behaviour and shear-induced contact fabric evolution of an idealised granular material subject to triaxial shearing. The ML-based framework is comprised of a set of mini-triaxial tests which provide a benchmark for the setup and validation of the discrete element method (DEM) model of the granular materials, a parametric DEM simulation programme of virtual triaxial tests which provides datasets of micro- and macro-mechanical information, as well as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network which is trained and tested using the DEM-based datasets. The ML model only requires the initial void ratio of the granular sample as the input for predicting its constitutive response. The excellent agreement between the ML model prediction and experimental test and DEM simulation results indicates that the ML–based modelling approach is capable of capturing accurately the effects of initial void ratio on the constitutive behaviour of idealised granular materials, bypassing the need to incorporate the complex micromechanics underlying the macroscopic mechanical behaviour of granular materials. Lastly, a detailed comparison between the used MLP model and long short-term memory (LSTM) model was made from the perspective of technical algorithm, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency.},

Instead of using closed-form phenomenological models or numerical multiscale modelling, machine learning has emerged as an alternative paradigm to revolutionise the constitutive modelling of granular materials. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) require massive training data and often fail to make credible extrapolations. This study aims to develop a deep active learning strategy to (i) identify unreliable forecasts without knowing the ground truth; and (ii) continuously improve and verify a data-driven constitutive model until the desired generalisation is satisfied. The role of active learning in constitutive modelling is instantiated through three scenarios: (i) off-line strain-stress data pool of granular materials; (ii) interactive constitutive training and strain-stress data labelling; and (iii) finite element modelling (FEM) driven by deep learning-based constitutive models. The results confirm the capability of active learning in advancing data-driven constitutive modelling of granular materials toward developing a faithful surrogate constitutive model with less data. The same active learning strategy can also be applied to other data-centric applications across various science and engineering fields.},

This paper proposes a paradigm-shifting methodology for the constitutive modelling of granular soils subject to triaxial shearing which integrates the techniques of X-ray micro computed tomography (micro-CT), three-dimensional discrete element modelling and deep learning. Firstly, the micro-CT data of Leighton Buzzard sand particles used to reconstruct particles in discrete element method simulations are obtained separately. Secondly, the tomography data of a series of representative sand particles is used to construct the three-dimensional discrete element model of the sand sample which is then used to generate the numerical datasets for the subsequent deep learning task. Thirdly, a deep learning model called the long short-term memory network is developed to capture the combined effects of particle shape, confining pressure, and initial sample density on the constitutive behaviour of sands. Lastly, the effectiveness of the deep learning model is shown by comparing the model prediction on the testing datasets with the numerical simulation results. Furthermore, the capability of the model on predicting the real sand behaviour is demonstrated by an excellent agreement between the model prediction based on the input of tomography data and the soil response measured from the triaxial test.},

However, data scarcity poses a significant challenge to this emerging paradigm. This study aims to tackle this issue by presenting two transfer learning-based strategies that harness well-established constitutive knowledge and similar material data to reduce data demands for data-driven material modelling. The first approach utilises phenomenological constitutive models to generate massive synthetic data which reflect the targeted material behaviour to train a base model. This base model is then repurposed for a new task based on numerical simulation data via transfer learning. The other approach involves using available material data to train a base model, which is then applied to other new materials that are similar but with limited data. The proposed transfer learning methods are tested on both particle-scale simulations of representative volume elements (RVEs) and hierarchical multiscale modelling of boundary value problems (BVPs) of granular materials. The trained data-driven material model is embedded in numerical simulations with the finite element method (FEM) to validate its accuracy, efficiency, and stability. The results demonstrate that transfer learning can effectively achieve high-quality machine learning predictions with limited data. The transfer learning strategy presented in this study is expected to be widely applicable to small data-driven material modelling.},

This work presents a data-driven model for modeling granular materials, with the material data being extracted from discrete element method (DEM) simulations. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is then employed to learn the mechanical behaviors of granular materials from the material dataset. Particular emphasis is placed on three elements: modification of LSTM unit cell, phase space sampling, and material history parameterization. The LSTM unit cell is modified so that the initial hidden state can be specified as the initial states of granular materials. Massive DEM simulations are performed to consider the effects of particle size distribution, initial density, confining pressure, and loading path on the mechanical behaviors of granular materials. The history-dependency of the granular materials is well represented by the architecture of the LSTM network and internal variable-based history parameterization. We compare the model predictions against DEM simulations to assess the performance of the proposed data-driven model. The results demonstrate that the model can predict the material behaviors of granular materials with different microstructures and initial states and reproduce the material responses under complex nonmonotonic loading paths.

A large DEM database comprising 217 DEM simulations of morphologically gene-mutated and gene-decayed samples was generated. Based on this database, three neural network models, i.e., the backpropagation neural networks (BPNN), long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM), and gate recurrent unit neural networks (GRU) were utilised to predict the constitutive behaviours of granular soils. After training and testing, all trained models can reasonably predict granular soils' deviatoric stress-volumetric strain-axial strain relationship. It is found that: 1) the effects of particle morphology at different length scales, sample initial packing state, and confining stress condition can be well captured by all these models; 2) LSTM and GRU outperform BPNN in predictive performance with more local information; 3) With fewer weights and biases, more efficient computation, and more stable and even error distributions for different stages of axial strains, GRU shows the best predictive performance, followed by LSTM and BPNN. Furthermore, all three models are tested by the μCT experimental data.

	abstract = {Machine learning offers a new approach to predicting the path-dependent stress–strain response of granular materials. Recent studies show that temporal convolution neural (TCN) networks, a mutation of the 1D convolution neural network (CNN), have a powerful capability of addressing time-related prediction tasks. In this work, TCN networks are constructed to explore their potential in capturing the constitutive law of granular materials. To train and test the TCN network, three types of numerical experiments are implemented to generate datasets via discrete element modelling. The Bayesian optimisation method is employed to find the optimum architecture of the network. Furthermore, to improve the training accuracy and efficiency, a transfer learning (TL) scheme is innovatively leveraged, which utilises the trained network parameters from a set of shorter time steps and/or coarser data points of the training strain–stress loading curves, as the initial values, to train the network for a longer time step. The prediction ability of the trained TCN network is assessed and compared with a recurrent neural network which has been proved to perform well in predicting constitutive laws of the granular materials. In addition, training datasets with artificially added noise are also used to test and analyse the robustness of TCN networks.},

The discrete element method, DEM, was used to generate 92,378 sphere packings that covered many different kinds of particle size distributions, PSD, lying within 2 particle sizes. These packings were subjected to triaxial compression and the corresponding stress–strain curves were fitted to Duncan–Chang hyperbolic models. An artificial neural network (NN) scheme was able to anticipate the value of the model parameters for all these PSDs, with an accuracy similar to the precision of the experiment and even when the NN was trained with a few hundred DEM simulations. The estimations were indeed more accurate than those given by multiple linear regressions (MLR) between the model parameters and common geotechnical and statistical descriptors derived from the PSD. This was achieved in spite of the presence of noise in the training data. Although the results of this massive simulation are limited to specific systems, ways of packing and testing conditions, the NN revealed the existence of hidden correlations between PSD of the macroscopic mechanical behavior.},

The excellent training and testing results reflect the superiority of LSTM in the constitutive modelling of granular soils under loading. Based on the previous study, twelve new samples with out-of-range particle morphology were generated to test the model extrapolation ability. It is found that the LSTM-based model has poor extrapolation ability with notable predictive differences when out-of-range input parameters are utilised. In light of this deficiency, deep transfer learning (DTL) is adopted to transfer the pre-trained model to the new out-of-range database quickly. The excellent training and testing results show that the DTL-LSTM can accurately predict cases with out-of-range particle morphology. DTL-LSTM is further compared with a newly trained LSTM model using the extended database, and an overall good agreement is obtained except for some slight differences of volumetric strain at small axial strains. Given the drastically reduced computational costs and the excellent predictive performance, DTL-LSTM is deemed to be suitable and competent in the constitutive modelling of granular soils with out-of-range data.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in the development of Eulerian incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (EISPH), such as high-order convergence and natural coupling with Lagrangian formulations, demonstrate its potential as a meshless alternative to traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. This work aims to address one of the major outstanding limitations of EISPH, its relatively high computational cost, by providing an implementation that can be deployed on multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). To this end, a pre-existing multi-GPU version of the open-source Lagrangian weakly-compressible code DualSPHysics is converted to an EISPH formulation and integrated with an open-source multi-GPU multigrid solver (AmgX) to treat the pressure Poisson equation implicitly. The integration of AmgX within DualSPHysics presents a significant challenge, since AmgX is designed for distributed systems and therefore conflicts with the single-node shared memory design of the multi-GPU DualSPHysics code. The present implementation is validated against well-known test cases, showing excellent agreement with benchmark solutions and demonstrating second-order convergence. A detailed profiling and performance testing is also presented to investigate memory consumption and scaling characteristics. The results show approximately 87\%–95\% strong scaling efficiency and 92\%–94\% weak scaling efficiency in both 2D and 3D on up to four GPUs. Large spikes in memory consumption during the initialisation of the linear solver library are found to impede full utilisation of the device memory. Nevertheless, the present implementation is shown to permit problem sizes on the order of 69.3 million (2D) and 20.8 million (3D) particles on four GPUs (128 GB total device memory), which is beyond what has previously been reported for incompressible SPH on GPUs, where the PPE is treated implicitly, and demonstrates its potential as an alternative to traditional CFD methods.},

A particle shifting technique constructing virtual fine particles (VFP-PST) is proposed to regularize the particle distribution for numrical accuracy and stability. To facilitate the device memory throughput efficiently, a dynamic resource management algorithm is used to implement GPU-accelerated adaptive particle refinement. Precision analysis shows the effect of the smooth length ratio of fine and coarse particles on numerical accuracy.

A unified updated Lagrangian SPH algorithm is developed for modelling both the fluid and solid simultaneously, which involves employment of the Lagrangian kernel for modelling solids to avoid the tension instability problem. Considering the high computational cost of large-scale problems, we develop an adaptive multi-resolution SPH with multi-GPUs acceleration. Specifically, coupling CUDA and MPI acceleration modes are proposed, which exploit the high computational capacity of GPU devices and the cross-device parallelism properties in multi-GPUs. To enhance the occupancy of each GPU, an efficient message-passing pattern and load balancing algorithm are of interest. To address the data race in multi-resolution SPH, a combination hybrid competition mode is proposed. Through a series of optimization algorithms, the numerical efficiency of the multi-resolution SPH approach in multi-GPUs parallel computing is further promoted. After verifying the parallel efficiency of these proposed algorithms in some typical free-surface flows, the proposed model is applied to solve the FSI problem including under-water explosion problem. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed accelerated algorithm for SPH modeling of large-scale FSI problems.},

The approach is based on a spatial decomposition technique, whereby different portions (sub-domains) of the physical system under study are assigned to different GPUs. Communication between devices is achieved with the use of Message Passing Interface (MPI) application programming interface (API) routines. The use of the sorting algorithm radix sort for inter-GPU particle migration and sub-domain “halo” building (which enables interaction between SPH particles of different sub-domains) is described in detail. With the resulting scheme it is possible, on the one hand, to carry out simulations that could also be performed on a single GPU, but they can now be performed even faster than on one of these devices alone. On the other hand, accelerated simulations can be performed with up to 32 million particles on the current architecture, which is beyond the limitations of a single GPU due to memory constraints. A study of weak and strong scaling behaviour, speedups and efficiency of the resulting program is presented including an investigation to elucidate the computational bottlenecks. Last, possibilities for reduction of the effects of overhead on computational efficiency in future versions of our scheme are discussed.},

Addressing these issues demands a fundamental understanding of flow physics and robust models to predict the multi-regime flow behavior of biomass particles. In this study, we investigated the multi-regime flow behavior of loblolly pine chips, a widely used bioenergy feedstock, through combined experiments and simulations. A quasi-static hypoplastic model and a cross-regime Drucker–Prager (DP)-μ(I) model were utilized and validated against inclined plane flow experiments to understand the quasi-static and dense flow behavior of milled pine chips. The results show that along the inclined plane, loblolly pine chips mainly present in heap flow (varying thickness along the plane), and in plane flow (iso-thickness along the plane) only when the inclination closes to the material’s critical state internal friction angle. The results also show that the multi-regime DP-μ(I) model predicts a completely different velocity profile from the hypoplastic model. DP-μ(I) model can capture the flow behavior of pine chips in both flow regimes well but at the cost of extra parameter determination, and the shear-rate dependent rheology model can successfully capture the flow of elongated high-frictional particles. These findings advance the scientific understanding of the multi-regime flow behavior of granular biomass materials and shed light on formulating novel constitutive models to assist granular biomass handling in the bioenergy industry.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Hoppers are widely used biomass handling devices that channel bulk biomass from storage to subsequent handling equipment. Jenike’s longstanding approach, based on the Mohr-Coulomb model, has been successfully used to design hoppers handling cohesionless granular materials such as grains and other agricultural produces. However, designing a hopper to ensure reliable biomass flow is found to be challenging due to cohesion, irregular particle shape, and bulk material elastoplasticity. This study aims to address the biomass handling engineering challenge with alternative constitutive material models concerning the flow behavior of bulk solids. Finite element modeling is an approach that allows for implementation of different material models, whose underlying constitutive theories assist in investigating the origin and manifestation of bulk mechanical behavior of granular materials. This study focuses on the incipient gravity hopper flow of two types of biomass feedstocks, i.e., ground corn stover and Douglas fir wood. Three widely used constitutive material models, i.e., Mohr-Coulomb model, modified Cam-Clay model, and Drucker-Prager/Cap model, are implemented. Using the flow pattern represented by the volume of biomass exhibiting more than 7\% of axial strain (Kamath and Puri, 1999), the finite element model predicts that the bulk corn stover particulate material forms an arch, which represents a hampered transition from the static state to the dynamic flow-state out of the hopper, whereas bulk Douglas fir wood particulate material develops a reliable mass flow pattern. A laboratory scale hopper was used to experimentally determine the biomass flow conditions, which were subsequently compared with the predicted onset of flow by a finite element model (FEM). The developed FEM was found to correctly predict the initiation of mass flow for the milled Douglas fir wood, whereas corn stover was predicted to establish a strong core flow suggesting an unreliable handling characteristic. This observation aligns with the reported poor handling of milled corn stover.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Unlike simple liquids and gases, the bulk flow and transport of granular materials remain poorly understood by physicists and pose many problems for engineers in designing and operating bulk-solids handling equipment. Discrete element methods (DEM) are currently considered the state-of-the-art for simulating the flow of granular materials, but DEM is limited in system size to about a few million particles due to high computational costs, even when run on current high-performance computing architectures. Continuum models are needed to simulate the flows of bulk solids in industrial-scale vessels and equipment, e.g., grain silos and coal-ash disposal piles. The focus of this work is the so-called nonlocal granular fluidity (NLGF) model that has been previously shown to reproduce observed nonlocal behaviors that arise when granular phenomena occur on length scales that are near the scale of the system geometry, e.g., the jamming of hopper outlets and the stop-height of piles on inclines [PNAS, 110(17), 6730-6735]. We have implemented the NLGF constitutive model in OpenFOAM CFD software, performed simulations of well-defined flow systems, and compared the results to experimental data. Experimental systems include a ring-shear tester, pile formation, flow on an incline, and discharge of a hopper. The tested material was loblolly pine wood chips that were milled and sieved to a size range of roughly 0.05-0.25 inches in diameter. The NLGF model parameters were tuned to achieve reasonable agreement between simulation and experimental results. Further, we evaluate the mapping between measurable material properties (bulk friction angle, particle-particle friction, compressibility, grain diameter, etc.) with NLGF model parameters, some of which have direct analogs (friction parameters and grain diameter) while others are constructs of the model (nonlocal amplitude and timescale of fluidity evolution).},

	abstract = {An intraparticle sampling technique has recently been developed revealing the evolution of chemical species during biomass decomposition. The analysis has shown that CO2 is produced up to 10\% concentration at 200°C, nearly coincidental with the evolution of CO, which reaches a maximum of 24\% at 325°C. Subsequent release of H2 reaches a maximum of 0.7\% at approximately 300°C. The release of these gases coincides with a commensurate mass loss of almost 70\% between 225°C and 350°C. Continued decomposition of the biomass results in the reduction of light gases as observed in the decline of hydrogen and CO2 concentrations and a sharp increase in higher hydrocarbons. For example at 440°C the concentrations of CO2 and H2 are 17\% and 0.4\%, respectively, while the CH4, C2H6 and C2H4 are 19\%, 1.2\% and 0.8\%, respectively. To complement this sampling approach, the thermo-fluid-dynamics of the process were assessed through a numerical model based on a finite volume method (fvm). The suction force applied by the microGC pump affects the pressure distribution within the particle. Nonetheless, the model demonstrates that the perturbing effect is confined to the inner part of the particle. In fact, the absolute pressure inside the particle is lower than 0.90, 0.95 and 0.99atm in only 1.28\%, 4.47\% and 30.07\%, respectively, of the interior volume. Therefore, the model demonstrates that utilizing a choked-flow sampling arrangement is preferred when extracting chemical species released during thermal decomposition.},

	abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing aimed at building a network of fractures in hot dry rock (HDR) often induces strong seismic risks. However, few studies have focused on seismic risks, and methods for increasing the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) while reducing seismic risks have not been adequately studied. Therefore, based on the full hydro-mechanical coupling, a seismic-fracturing model with a discrete fracture network (DFN) was developed, and the methods for increasing the SRV while reducing the seismic risk of horizontal wells at the FORGE site in Utah were discussed. The results showed that the fluid channeling effect between each segment is the main reason for the uneven fracture growth in the horizontal well. Additionally, the spatiotemporal evolution of fracturing-induced seismicity shows that the two ends (L1 and L3) of the horizontal well tend to form high stress concentrations and induce larger seismic events than the middle (L2). To solve these problems, a novel hydraulic fracturing method with a differentiated-stage, variable-injection volume suitable for the multi-fracturing of horizontal wells in HDR was proposed. With the application of the method, the SRV of the horizontal well was improved effectively, and the average magnitude induced by hydraulic fracturing was also decreased by 15.4\%.},

To that end, here we develop a poroelastic model of earthquake nucleation based on rate-and-state friction in the manner of spring–sliders, and analyze conditions for the emergence of stick-slip frictional instability—the mechanism for earthquakes—by carrying out a linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations. We find that the likelihood of triggering earthquakes depends largely on the rate of increase in pore pressure rather than its magnitude. Consequently, fluid injection at constant rate acts in the direction of triggering seismic rupture at early times followed by aseismic creep at late times. Our model implies that, for the same cumulative volume of injected fluid, an abrupt high-rate injection protocol is likely to increase the seismic risk whereas a gradual step-up protocol is likely to decrease it.},

The test system consists of a high-power microwave subsystem (100 kW), a true triaxial testing machine, a dynamic monitoring subsystem, and an electromagnetic shielding subsystem. It can realize rapid microwave-induced fracturing, intelligent tuning of impedance, dynamic feedback under strong microwave fields, and active control of microwave parameters by addressing the following issues: the instability and insecurity of the system, the discharge breakdown between coaxial lines during high-power microwave output, and a lack of feedback of rock-microwave response. In this study, microwave-induced surface and borehole fracturing tests under true triaxial stress were carried out. Experimental comparisons imply that high-power microwave irradiation can reduce the fracturing time of hard rock and that the fracture range (160 mm) of a 915-MHz microwave source is about three times that of 2.45 GHz. After microwave-induced borehole fracturing, many tensile cracks occur on the rock surface and in the borehole: the maximum reduction of the P-wave velocity is 12.8\%. The test results show that a high-power microwave source of 915 MHz is more conducive to assisting mechanical rock breaking and destressing. The system can promote the development of microwave-assisted rock breaking equipment.},

The test system comprises a true triaxial stress loading system, an open-ended microwave-induced fracturing system, a data acquisition system, an acoustic emission (AE) monitoring system, and an auxiliary specimen loading system. Microwave-induced surface and borehole fracturing tests under true triaxial stress were fulfilled for the first time, which overcomes the problem of microwave leakage in the coupling loading of true triaxial stress and microwave. By developing the dynamic monitoring system, the thermal response and fracture evolution were obtained during microwave irradiation. The monitoring system includes the infrared thermometry technique for monitoring rock surface temperature, the distributed optic fiber sensing technique for monitoring temperature in borehole in rock, the AE technique and two-dimensional digital speckle correlation technique for monitoring the evolution of thermal damage and the rock fracturing process. To validate the advantages of the test system and investigate the characteristics of microwave-induced fracturing of hard rocks, the study demonstrates the experimental methods and results for microwave-induced surface and borehole fracturing under true triaxial stress. The results show that thermal cracking presented intermittent characteristics (calm–active–calm) during microwave-induced surface and borehole fracturing of basalt. In addition, true triaxial stress can inhibit the development and distribution of thermal cracks during microwave-induced surface fracturing. When microwave-induced borehole fracturing occurs, it promotes the distribution of thermal cracks in rock, but inhibits the width of cracks. The results also prove the reliability of the test system.},

The device includes a cutting system, a rotary translation system, a loading system, a high-power microwave system, and a control and monitoring system. The technology of “master-slave follow-up” disc cutter alternating side cutting of rock was proposed, which could improve the effectiveness of rock breaking. The integrated structure of a microwave-cut system was then proposed, and synchronous motion of the microwave-cut system and adjustment of the loading system could be realized. The automatic adjustment technology of the microwave working distance was developed to dynamically control the optimal microwave working distance. The basic functions of the equipment were verified by tests. By comparing the two types of disk cutters, it is found that the master-slave follow-up disk cutter can improve significantly the dust removal effect and rock breaking efficiency in rock breaking process versus the conventional large disc cutter. Cutting tests of slate with or without microwave were conducted using a master-slave follow-up disk cutter. The results show that the cutting patterns of slates change from intermittent chunks (without microwave irradiation) to persistent debris (with microwave irradiation), and the cutting speed is significantly improved (170\%). The development of the device provides a scientific basis for changing the conventional mining technology of metal mines and realizing the mechanical continuous mining in hard metal mines.},

While various applications in our daily lives and industries utilize the heating of electronic conductors, little attention has been paid to the potential of ionic conductors for heating purposes. This is because of the “inevitable” electrochemical reactions, which can result in unwanted electrolysis of conductors, corrosion of electrodes, and surface fouling. This paper reports the Joule heating of ionic conductors without electrochemical reactions. Electricity with a zero-phase frequency is employed to suppress the electrolysis of ionic conductors at high voltages. Demonstrations with various ionic conductors, both liquids and solids, show highly efficient energy conversion free of electrochemical reactions. This heating method is simple, direct, fast, clean, and uniform, and it has great potential in numerous industrial and household applications.},

	abstract = {In the electrical-Joule-heating process, the reservoirs are heated in situ by dissipation of electrical energy to reduce the viscosity of oil. In principle, electrical current passes through the reservoir fluids mostly because of the electrical conductivity of saturated fluids such as saline water. The flow of electrical current through the reservoir raises the heat in the reservoir and thereby dramatically reduces the oil viscosity.In this process, electrical current can flow between electrical-potential sources (electrodes) in wells, and then electrical energy is dissipated to generate the heat. Therefore, the regions around the electrodes in (or around) the wells are extremely heated. Because the wells act as line sources for the electrical potential, greater heating takes place near the wellbore, causing possible vaporization of water in that region. Because steam has very-low electrical conductivity, it can reduce the efficiency of this process significantly. In this process electrical conductivity plays a very important role. To increase efficiency of this type of heating process, the presence of optimum saline-water saturation is an essential factor.To model the electrical Joule heating in the presence of multiphase-fluid flow, we use three Maxwell classical electromagnetism equations. These equations are simplified and assumed for low frequency to obtain the conservation of the electrical-current equation and Ohm's law. The conservation of electrical current and Ohm's law are implemented by use of a finite-difference method in a four-phase chemical-flooding reservoir simulator (UTCHEM 2011.7). The Joule-heating rate caused by dissipation of electrical energy is calculated and added to the energy equation as a source term.The formulation and implementation of electrical heating are validated against a reference analytical solution and verified with a reservoir simulator. A typical-reservoir model is built, and constant electrical potential with alternating current is applied to the model to study the efficiency of the electrical-heating process properly. The efficiency of this process is evaluated in the presence of water-saturated fractures and evaporation effect. Results illustrate that water saturation in the presence of fractures and electrical conductivity of saturated rock have an important effect on the Joule-heating process. The importance of the fractures saturated by saline water and operation of such processes below the boiling point are key findings in this paper to obtain high recovery in comparison with other conventional-thermal-recovery methods.},

We include a sustainable, flexible research software framework for plant-scale model development. This is an improved model concept for fluid dynamic processes, evaporation, root water uptake. We have developed a general model concept and a flexible software framework for the description of plant-scale soil?root interaction processes including the essential fluid mechanical processes in the vadose zone. The model was developed in the framework of non-isothermal, multiphase, multicomponent flow and transport in porous media. The software is an extension of the open-source porous media flow and transport simulator DuMux to embedded mixed-dimensional coupled schemes. Our coupling concept allows us to describe all processes in a strongly coupled form and adapt the complexity of the governing equations in favor of either accuracy or computational efficiency. We have developed the necessary numerical tools to solve the strongly coupled nonlinear partial differential equation systems that arise with a locally mass conservative numerical scheme even in the context of evolving root architectures. We demonstrate the model concept and its features, discussing a virtual hydraulic lift experiment including evaporation, root tracer uptake on a locally refined grid, the simultaneous simulation of root growth and root water uptake, and an irrigation scenario comparing different models for flow in unsaturated soil. We have analyzed the impact of evaporation from soil on the soil water distribution around a single plant's root system. Moreover, we have shown that locally refined grids around the root system increase computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that the assumptions behind the Richards equation may be violated under certain conditions.},

	abstract = {Associations between minerals and organic matter represent one of the most important carbon storage mechanisms in soils. Plant roots are major sources of soil carbon, and resolving the dynamics and dominance of microbial consumption versus mineral sorption of root-derived carbon is critical to understanding soil carbon storage. Here we integrate in-situ rhizosphere microsensor and plant physiological measurements with a 3-D plant-soil reactive transport model to explore the fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the rhizosphere, particularly its microbial consumption and interaction with Fe oxide minerals. Over several days, microdialysis probes at the root-soil interface of growing Vicia faba roots in live soil, revealed clear diel patterns of DOC concentration in the pore water. Daytime DOC spikes coincided with peaks in leaf-level photosynthesis rates and were accompanied by declining redox potential and dissolved oxygen as well as increasing pH in the rhizosphere. Incorporating microsensor data into our modeling framework showed that the measured rapid loss of DOC after each mid-day spike could not be explained by consumption via aerobic respiration, nor via anaerobic respiration dominated by Fe oxide reduction. Rather, in the model, a large fraction of rhizosphere DOC was rapidly immobilized each day by adsorption to Fe oxides. Further, modeled microbial Fe reduction (fueled by DOC) did not mobilize significant organic carbon from Fe oxides during the day. Instead, the model predicted equilibrium desorption of organic carbon from Fe oxides at night. This new mechanistic modeling framework, which couples aboveground plant physiological measurements with non-destructive high-resolution monitoring of rhizosphere processes, has great potential for exploring the dynamics and balance of the various microbial reactions and mineral interactions controlling carbon storage in soils.},

	abstract = {Trees growing in acid soils often suffer from nutrient imbalances and inadequate supply of base cations (Mb) but correlations between soil chemical conditions and nutritional status of forest trees are often inconclusive. Therefore, there is a need of studies that assess the Mb acquisition potential of the absorbing fine roots from the rhizosphere soil. Previous rhizosphere models, mostly implemented as a single-ion model (SIM), calculate the actual root nutrient uptake rates. But SIM often fail to reproduce measurements which is interpreted as being caused by root-induced ionic interactions. Hence, a multi-ion model (MIM) is presented which simultaneously describes the rhizospheric dynamics of H+, Al3+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, NH4+, NO3−, SO42−, H2PO4− and Cl− which takes into account interactions among the ions involved. In MIM the ion diffusion transport is modeled via the Nernst–Planck equation. A root-induced constant or daily-patterned water flux is assumed. The cation sorption is defined according to the cation selectivity approach. Al-solution complexes and a kinetic expression of the dissolution or precipitation of Al(OH)3(s) (gibbsite) are included in MIM. The selective nutrient root uptake is balanced by the excretion of H+ (cation uptake excess) or OH− (anion uptake excess) ions. These model features guarantee electro neutrality in the rhizosphere system but lead to ionic interactions. The objectives of this study are to calculate the rhizospheric gradients of protons, Al3+ ions and base cations (Mb), their concentration changes at the root surface (RS) and in rhizospheric sub-volumes termed as soil–root interface (SRI) and inner rhizosphere (Rh). It is hypothesized that root-induced changes of pH and the pH-dependent dissolution or precipitation of Al(OH)3(s) affect the rhizospheric concentration gradients and the actual root uptake rates (UMb) of Mb cations. In various scenarios the hypothesis is tested on the basis of different ion concentrations in the bulk soil and root uptake capacities of nitrogen and Mb ions. The simulations demonstrate that the rates of root excretions as H+ or OH− ions are determined by the preferential nitrogen root uptake as NH4+ or NO3−, respectively. A high NH4+ root uptake leads to a decrease of rhizospheric pH and a dissolution of Al(OH)3(s). An accumulation of Al3+ cations in solution and exchanger mostly on RS and in SRI is calculated due to water flux and Al(OH)3(s)-dissolution. Accumulation of exchangeable Al3+ cations cause an enhanced desorption of Mb cations in SRI if compared with SIM-results and lead to a Mb concentration increase in Rh-solution and a RS-depletion for Ca2+ and K+. MIM-calculated UMb are slightly higher compared with SIM-calculated UMb. A high NO3− root uptake leads to a rhizospheric pH increase, a depletion of Al3+ in rhizospheric solution and exchanger also at water flux caused by an Al(OH)3(s)-formation, an accumulation of exchangeable Mb cations mainly in SRI, a Mb-depletion in rhizospheric soil solution and to significantly lower UMb if compared with SIM-results. Al(OH)3(s)-induced differences in rhizospheric Mb gradients and UMb-values are determined by the magnitude of the H+/OH− root excretion rates, are highest at low Mb solution concentrations, and also occur in extremely low Al3+ bulk soil solution concentrations. An Al(OH)3(s)-formation may be inhibited at high Al3+ bulk soil solution concentrations and high H+-concentrations in solution and exchanger of the bulk soil. The range of calculated Mb depletions and accumulations in SRI and Rh correspond to the measurement results reported in the literature. It is concluded that, in contrast to SIM, MIM-simulations present asynchronous ion concentration gradients in soil solution and exchanger which include opposite concentration gradients. At NO3− surplus a high NO3− root uptake and a low availability of Mb cations may lead to wide NO3−:Mb root uptake ratios and tree nutrient imbalances.},

	abstract = {Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are engineered reservoirs that have been stimulated to extract efficiently heat from low permeability hot rock. Generating efficient hydraulic pathways for heat exchange is crucial. A 3-dimensional Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model was developed for simulating and determining the optimum hydraulic fracture network for the proposed Phase 3 injection and production wells at a Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) site in Utah. Numerical simulations are used to study hydrogeothermal transport in the fractured media. The effect natural fractures contribute to hydraulic fracture growth were studied in regard to changes in natural fracture intensity, flow rate, hydraulic pathways, permeability, and perforation cluster spacing. Post hydraulic fracturing networks are incorporated into a hydrothermal modeling package where a possible range of heat extraction values are determined from the reservoir over a 30-year production period. Results suggest that DFN modeling in an EGS setting has exceptional value. The study serves as a benchmark for developing an improved understanding of the effects of the existing FORGE natural fracture systems. The simulations suggest an optimized pumping schedule that generates conductive post-stimulation fracture networks between hypothetical Phase 3 injection and production wells and establishes an effective hydrological thermal model under various fluid flow conditions. A more viscous fluid increases the fracture height and significantly effects fracture growth in the middle cluster. Injection temperature and flow rate are two of most important parameters that control the production temperature and heat recovery.},

This applies not only to the demand for minimizing the consumption of energy, water, and reagents, but also to the reduction of residual materials, especially fine and difficult-to-landfill materials. Sensor-based ore sorting can be used as a separation process for coarser grain sizes before the application of fine comminution and separation technologies and is applicable for a large variety of mineral raw materials. Sensor-based ore sorting applies at various points in the process flow diagram and is suitable for waste elimination, for material diversion into different process lines, for the production of pre- and final concentrates, as well as for the reprocessing of coarse-grained waste dumps and other applications.

A particular strength of the technology is the flexibility in sorting decisions, which is achieved by using various sensors and programming the data analysis.

The implicit-pressure explicit-saturation (IMPES) scheme is employed such that only a single CNN needs to be trained per time step. Dirichlet boundary conditions are not a mandatory requirement for PICNN-based implicit solver but act as labeled data that can help enhance accuracy. The proposed approach is validated in homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs and aspects including efficiency and accuracy are discussed. In addition, we demonstrate that the CNN structure can be trained as a data-driven surrogate for two-phase Darcy flows given sufficient labeled samples.},

This leads to the formation of a nonlinear system of partial differential equations. To solve this direct problem, it is necessary to linearize the equation system. Algorithm construction for inverse problem solution is problematic since the numerical solution is unstable. The application of implicit methods is reduced to matrix equations with a high rank of the coefficient matrix, which requires significant computational resources. The authors of this paper investigated the possibility of parameterized function (physics-informed neural networks) application to solve direct and inverse problems of non-Newtonian fluid flows in porous media. The results of laboratory experiments to process core samples and field data from a real oil field were selected as examples of application of this method.

	abstract = {We present a new well model aimed at simulating deep and superhot geothermal wells within reservoir-scale flow models. The model uses a classic multi-segment approach to solve the well hydrodynamics but also includes several important features significantly expanding its capabilities. Firstly, we use thermodynamic tables allowing us to accurately model fluids at all relevant pressures, temperatures and salinity conditions up to magmatic conditions. The well model can account for the transport of dissolved NaCl salt and its potential precipitation in the form of halite. Secondly, the model includes an air phase and incorporates the transient displacement of the air-water interface in the well. This allows us to simulate the starting of the well using the air pressurization technique. Lastly, the well model is coupled to an unstructured reservoir grid on which magma bodies and feed zones can be explicitly represented. This paper introduces the technical details of the well model and presents several applications showcasing what insights could be gained concerning the performance of deep geothermal wells. We conducted two sets of simulation: first, we simulated a deep resource resulting from strongly enhanced heat flux with a well and a single feedzone; we assessed the effects of the feedzone's permeability, temperature and salinity on well starting and initial performance. In a second set of simulations, we used a more realistic hydrothermal system, driven by a magmatic intrusion. From the results we illustrate examples of which factors control the ability of the well to self-start, if and how air pressurization can aid starting wells, how production from a supercritical resource created near a magmatic intrusion may evolve over up to 200 years, and how halite precipitation may rapidly clog the well in case of production from saline superhot resources.},

	abstract = {Superhot geothermal environments in granitic crusts of ca. 400–500 °C and depths of 2–4 km are recognized as a frontier of geothermal energy. In developing such environments, hydraulic fracturing is a promising way to create or recreate permeable fracture networks to effectively access the energy through enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). However, there is a concern about the possibility of stabilizing or enhancing the permeability created by hydraulic fracturing, required for sustainable and profitable energy production, because pressure solution of the fracture surfaces may reduce permeability. On the other hand, permeability may be enhanced by free-face dissolution of the fracture surfaces even if pressure solution occurs. However, the rates of permeability reduction and enhancement are not fully understood, and the possibility of stabilizing/enhancing permeability is therefore unclear. We have conducted hydrothermal flow-through experiments on 400 °C fractured granite samples to clarify the influences of stress level and plasticity of the fracture on the rate of permeability reduction by pressure solution and the influences of pore water pressure and corresponding mineral solubility on the rate of permeability enhancement by free-face dissolution. Results suggest that permeability may be either stabilized or enhanced in superhot EGS even when pressure solution can occur by keeping the difference between the concentration of the pore water and the solubility of quartz higher than the stress-dependent permeability stabilization criterion.},

These systems have garnered attention in recent years as a possible type of unconventional geothermal resource that could yield much higher well productivities due to their very high enthalpy fluids. Supercritical conditions are often found at the roots of volcanic-hosted hydrothermal systems. Deep wells drilled in geothermal fields such as The Geysers and Salton Sea, USA, Kakkonda, Japan, Larderello, Italy, Krafla, Iceland and Los Humeros, Mexico, have encountered temperatures in excess of 374°C, and in some cases have encountered fluid entries. The IDDP-1 well at Krafla encountered magma, and ended up producing very high enthalpy fluids; however these fluids were very corrosive and abrasive. Innovative drilling and well completion techniques may be needed to deal with the extreme temperatures and aggressive fluid chemistry compositions of these systems. New efforts are underway in Japan (northern Honshu), Italy (Larderello), Iceland (Reykjanes peninsula), Mexico (Los Humeros), and New Zealand (Taupo Volcanic Zone) to investigate supercritical systems. The Japan Beyond Brittle Project (JBBP), the New Zealand Hotter and Deeper Project (HADES), the FP7 project IMAGE as well as the Horizon 2020 projects DEEPEGS, DESCRAMBLE, GeoWell and GEMex, funded by the European Commission, provide an unprecedented opportunity for international collaboration to help solve the technical challenges associated with characterizing, drilling, and developing these high temperature systems. To facilitate interaction, METI Japan organized a meeting with invited representatives from selected G7 countries to discuss international collaboration for supercritical geothermal development as a part of the Innovation for Cool Earth Forum (ICEF) 2016.

	abstract = {Super-hot rock geothermal is an emerging source of renewable and carbon-free energy. This paper is the first attempt to explore fluid and heat flow dynamics in the reservoir-wellbore coupled system, to assess the power generation performance of a super-hot ({\textgreater}450 °C) enhanced geothermal system (EGS). We developed a high-performance code and built a 3-D wellbore-reservoir coupled model based on data from a recently completed deep-drilling project at Larderello, Italy. The general pattern of the super-hot EGS is characterized by a significant temperature plummet ({\textgreater}60 °C), after which the production fluid evolves from steam to a two-phase mixture till the end of the operation period. Reservoir pressure emerges as a key parameter to determine the temperature of the two-phase mixture. By realistically capturing phase transitions driven by coupled thermo-hydraulic processes during operations, our numerical model predicts a lower power generation efficiency compared to previous attempts based on ultra-simplified models. Although finalized at assessing the thermodynamic viability of a specific system, this modeling approach provides general information on fundamental thermo-hydraulic processes in the Earth crust that might be applied for the design of similar EGS projects elsewhere.},

Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) have emerged as a promising avenue for renewable and sustainable energy production. However, the development of EGS faces a significant challenge in drilling through hard rock formations at high temperatures, necessitating specialized drilling equipment and techniques. This study aims to investigate the current state-of-the-art technology for drilling in hard rock formations under elevated temperatures, specifically in the context of super-hot EGS development. It involves a comprehensive review of previous projects and a meticulous analysis of existing drilling technologies and techniques. Furthermore, a techno-economic evaluation will be conducted to assess the feasibility of super-hot EGS development in hard igneous formations, considering key factors such as drilling performance, operational challenges, and material costs. The outcomes of this study will enhance the understanding of the technical challenges associated with super-hot EGS development and facilitate the design of efficient and cost-effective drilling technologies for the geothermal energy industry. By improving the drilling process in EGS development, the full potential of geothermal energy can be harnessed as a viable and sustainable energy source to meet the growing global demand for electricity.},

	abstract = {Superhot geothermal environments with temperatures of approximately 400–500 °C at depths of approximately 2–4 km are attracting attention as new kind of geothermal resource. In order to effectively exploit the superhot geothermal resource through the creation of enhanced geothermal systems (superhot EGSs), hydraulic fracturing is a promising technique. Laboratory-scale hydraulic fracturing experiments of granite have recently demonstrated the formation of a dense network of permeable fractures throughout the entire rock body, referred to as a cloud-fracture network, at or near the supercritical temperature for water. Although the process has been presumed to involve continuous infiltration of low-viscosity water into preexisting microfractures followed by creation and merger of the subsequent fractures, a plausible criterion for cloud-fracture network formation is yet to be clarified. The applicability of the Griffith failure criterion is supported by hydraulic fracturing experiments with acoustic emission measurements of granite at 400 °C under true triaxial stress and at 450 °C under conventional triaxial stress. The present study provides, for the first time, a theoretical basis required to establish the procedure for hydraulic fracturing in the superhot EGS.},

A major challenge when operating wells under such conditions is managing scaling in an effective manner. In this study, the thermodynamics of the precipitation and scaling of crystalline NaCl (halite) under superhot conditions is explored using the H2O–NaCl system as a proxy. Phase diagrams in pressure–enthalpy and pressure–entropy coordinates are used to illustrate how scaling occurs in idealized processes, such as the isenthalpic expansion of geothermal fluid to the wellhead or the isentropic power generation of a steam turbine. Particular emphasis is placed on explaining the non-trivial graphical composition of these phase diagrams in an accessible manner. A wellhead sample and an estimate of the downhole conditions are used as points of reference in the discussion of scaling. All thermodynamic properties, including the solubility of NaCl in water vapor, are calculated using a newly developed equation of state by the same authors as in this article.},

	abstract = {The Los Humeros Geothermal Field (LHGF) is one of the highest producing geothermal areas in Mexico. This paper aims essentially to determine high-resolution patterns of distribution of hypogene alteration assemblages and the distribution of temperatures in space and time of geothermal fluids in the LHGF. The zoning of hypogene alteration assemblages in the LHGF consists of (1) shallow advanced argillic alteration assemblages that grade into (2) argillic and (3) zeolitic assemblages with depth, followed by (4) low-temperature and (5) high-temperature propylitic, and (6) deep high-temperature high-silica advanced argillic alteration assemblages. The distribution of deep advanced argillic alteration assemblages is associated with the occurrence of acidic supercritical fluids prior to their deep boiling. Capping these, high-temperature propylitic assemblages are associated with the occurrence of subcritic brines (barely exceeding 13 wt\% NaCl equiv.) that stemmed from magmatic supercritic fluids (upon degassing and/or conductive cooling) and that were diluted by deeply circulated and thermally equilibrated meteoric water. Conductively cooled subcritic fluids, which eventually kept being diluted on their way to the surface, would be likely associated with the generation of shallow low-temperature propylitic assemblages. Relatively fresh meteoric water might have been increasingly relevant in such dilution as upwelling fluids neared the surface. Shallow boiling occurred mostly between high- and medium-temperature propylitic zones, and generated acidic vapors that eventually condensated in the phreatic water table and, in part, in the argillic alteration zone. Shallow hypogene advanced argillic (and argillic) alteration consisting of kaolinite, platy alunite, native sulfur and the newly found cuprocopiapite occurred in steam-heated grounds. Fluid inclusion and present-day geothermal fluid data allow to introduce relative time as a variable in the characterization of hydrothermal fluids in the LHGF. These sets of temperature data allow to independently determine patterns of temperature distribution as isotherms. Concave shapes in isotherms are interpreted to spearhead preferential passageways for hydrothermal fluids. Some areas (for instance, in the southern part of the LHGF) record relatively stable passageways through time, but these may significantly shift their positions in other areas. Stable passageways, apparently undisturbed by geothermal exploitation, may identify robust portions of the system that ensure a long-lasting exploitation. They also correspond to sound inputs of high-salinity and hot magmatic fluids, which may be sandwiched between cooler low-salinity fluids, dominantly meteoric in origin, and collectively make a case for convection (and partial mixing). Also, we determined that “older” inclusion fluids are ∼50 °C higher than “younger” fluids from geothermal wells, but such decrease can be compatible with the cooling down of the system due to geothermal exploitation. Therefore, such differences in temperature do not necessarily reflect an actual cooling in the system.},

Although fracturing in a two-dimensional plane is well understood, all fractures are extended in and propagate through three-dimensional space. Moreover, their behaviour is complex. Here we show that the forward propagation of a fracture front occurs through an initial rupture, nucleated at some localized position, followed by a very rapid transverse expansion at velocities as high as the Rayleigh-wave speed. We study fracturing in a circular geometry that achieves an uninterrupted extended fracture front and use a fluid to control the loading conditions that determine the amplitude of the forward jump. We find that this amplitude correlates with the transverse velocity. Dynamic rupture simulations capture the observations for only a high transverse velocity. These results highlight the importance of transverse dynamics in the forward propagation of an extended fracture.},

	abstract = {Fervo Energy has completed construction of a commercial enhanced geothermal system (EGS) project and has qualified full functionality of the system through production testing at commercially relevant operating conditions. The project site is located in a nearfield setting adjacent to an operating geothermal power station in north-central Nevada and is designed to deliver an uplift in high-temperature geothermal flow rates to increase the power capacity at the facility. The project involved drilling a first-of-a-kind EGS horizontal doublet well system, consisting of an injection and production well pair within a high-temperature, hard rock geothermal formation. The lithology of the target reservoir is characterized as a mixed metasedimentary and igneous formation, comprised of phyllite, quartzite, diorite, and granodiorite, representative of the geology across the most prospective geothermal areas throughout the western US. The lateral sections of the wells were drilled with 9 7/8" hole size, completed with 7" casing, extended approximately 3,250 ft horizontally, and reached a maximum measured temperature of 376 \${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$F. A modern multistage, plug-and-perforate stimulation treatment design with proppant was used to enhance the permeability of both horizontal wells. A 37-day crossflow production test was performed in April-May 2023, confirming that the EGS wells are connected hydraulically by a highly conductive fracture network. During production testing, the system achieved flow rates of up to 63 L/s, production temperatures of up to 336 \${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$F and a peak power production of 3.5 MW electric power equivalent. Flow profile wireline logs were performed on the horizontal injection well during the crossflow test, validating that the stimulation treatment design resulted in flow allocation along the entire lateral. Production temperature increased continuously throughout the test, indicating that no significant thermal short-circuit pathways were created during stimulation operations.Based on a review of historic EGS projects, Fervo's horizontal doublet well design is most productive EGS system to-date in terms of flow rate and electric power equivalent. In successfully completing this project, we have demonstrated that no major technical barriers exist to deploying horizontal EGS systems in similar metasedimentary or igneous formations up to temperatures of approximately 400 \${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$F. Numerical reservoir simulation models calibrated with the field data from this project demonstrate a clear innovation pathway to increasing the power capacity up to 8 MW of electric power per production well, meeting or exceeding the performance criteria outlined in Advanced Scenario the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's 2023 Annual Technology Bulletin for geothermal energy.},

	abstract = {In the oil drilling process, drilling costs account for more than 50\% of total E\&P costs. High-voltage electric pulse rock breaking is an economical and effective rock-breaking method that has received widespread attention. At present, there is not much research on the influence of the shape of the electrode tip on high-voltage pulse rock breaking. This paper establishes a system of equations that control the electric breakdown field based on the changes in the electric field inside the rock. Then, using this model, we conducted simulation and laboratory experiments to understand how rocks break under different conditions, such as load voltages, electrode spacing, and electrode tip shapes. The results show that the volume of broken rock is directly related to the loading voltage. The best loading voltage range is between 200 and 220 kV. Increasing the spacing between electrodes helps break more rock, but if the electrode spacing is too large, it's hard to make a hole in the rock, and the rock won't break. An electrode spacing of around 35 mm is the best. The shape of different electrode tips directly affects the high-voltage pulse breaking effect. Hemispherical electrode tips are less favorable for rock breaking, while oval electrode tips are the best. The laboratory experiments and simulations give the same conclusions and verify the applicability and correctness of our model. This study aims to help design high-voltage electric pulse devices.},

	abstract = {By utilizing stimulation technologies, the enhanced geothermal system has emerged as a highly promising technology in harvesting geothermal energy. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research and technologies of fracture stimulation in enhanced geothermal systems, including hydraulic stimulation mechanisms and design strategies. The understanding of hydraulic stimulation mechanisms is critical to the successful development of enhanced geothermal systems. Therefore, we summarized four major types of hydraulic stimulation mechanisms, and compared their impacts on the performance of enhanced geothermal systems. Next, a thorough review of 19 representative enhanced geothermal systems projects across the world is presented, in which the hydraulic stimulation design strategies are analyzed in depth. In the comparison of the projects, we mainly focus on the investigation of the impacts of in-situ geomechanical conditions and reservoir responses during hydraulic stimulation treatments. Based on the findings from the comparison, we proposed a series of feasible criteria for hydraulic stimulation design. Moreover, we reviewed the most recent advances in measurement tools and hydraulic stimulation facilities for practical hydraulic stimulation operations. We particularly clarified the difference between hydraulic stimulation operations in geothermal reservoirs and those in oil/gas fields. We aim to comprehensively answer a critical question: which techniques from the petroleum industry can be applied to the geothermal industry and which cannot? Overall, through this work, we intend to provide useful guidelines for both theoretical research and field operations of enhanced geothermal systems.},

	abstract = {Enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs) are an emerging energy technology with the potential to greatly expand the viable resource base for geothermal power generation. Although EGSs have traditionally been envisioned as ‘baseload’ resources, flexible operation of EGS wellfields could allow these plants to provide load-following generation and long-duration energy storage. In this work we evaluate the impact of operational flexibility on the long-run system value and deployment potential of EGS power in the western United States. We find that load-following generation and in-reservoir energy storage enhance the role of EGS power in least-cost decarbonized electricity systems, substantially increasing optimal geothermal penetration and reducing bulk electricity supply costs compared to systems with inflexible EGSs or no EGSs. Flexible geothermal plants preferentially displace the most expensive competing resources by shifting their generation on diurnal and seasonal timescales, with round-trip energy storage efficiencies of 59–93\%. Benefits of EGS flexibility are robust across a range of electricity market and geothermal technology development scenarios.},

	url = {https://dx.doi.org/10.56952/ARMA-2023-0936},
	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Dynamic loading offers the potential to induce densely connected fractured pore space over large bulk volumes of impermeable rock. An understanding of the impacts of the dynamic loading and unloading rates on the resulting fracturing can guide the design of discharge technologies. This work numerically investigates the dependence of the extent of fracturing on dynamic loading characteristics. We reconcile a high-fidelity model (finite-discrete element method with nonlinear fracture mechanics) with experimental observations. The model is subsequently used to simulate various loading scenarios spanning laboratory to field scale conditions.INTRODUCTION. In contrast to hydraulic fracturing, high-energy dynamic loads generate radial fractures which are not influenced by formation stress anisotropy. This removes the need for determining the in-situ stress orientation, which is a necessary factor in designing horizontal wells that undergo multiple hydraulic fracturing treatments. This study aims to investigate the effect of different dynamic load functions on seismic fracturing.One way to create high-energy dynamic loads is to use explosives (e.g., Grady et al. (Grady et al., 1980), Banadaki et al. (Banadaki, 2010), Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2017), and Jeong et al. (Jeong et al., 2020)). Explosives generate loading pulses with a maximum peak pressure that can exceed 1 GPa and a rise time of the pressure waveform on the order of 1 to 2 microseconds. Experiences using explosives are well-documented and span applications in various materials like granite, shale, and PMMA. The body of reported experiments shows that the extent of crack propagation depends on the energy released by the explosive charge, although a quantitative understanding of this relationship remains elusive for formations in the deep subsurface which cannot be observed directly or with great resolution. Another type of technology delivers the dynamic load using shock waves created in liquid. Hamelin et al. (Haimson and Fairhurst, 1967), Maurel et al. (Maurel et al., 2010), Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2012), and Xiao et al. (Xiao et al., 2018) for instance, applied Pulsed Arc Electrohydraulic Discharges (PAED) to produce shock waves in water. These loading profiles typically involve a longer time for the load to reach its peak. Moreover, in the case of laboratory experiments, reflections of shock waves from the finite samples may create extra fractures. To study the potential of formation fracturing at the field scale, large sample sizes, a wide variety of high energy loadings, and accurate diagnostics are needed. Given the challenge and costs of such extensive experimentation, numerical simulation can offer a useful alternative to narrow down the range of pulses to be investiated.},

	abstract = {Assessing seismic hazards remains one of the most challenging scientific issues in Earth sciences. Deep tectonic processes are classically considered as the only persistent mechanism driving the stress loading of active faults over a seismic cycle. Here we show via a mechanical model that erosion also significantly influences the stress loading of thrust faults at the timescale of a seismic cycle. Indeed, erosion rates of about {\textasciitilde}0.1–20 mm yr−1, as documented in Taiwan and in other active compressional orogens, can raise the Coulomb stress by {\textasciitilde}0.1–10 bar on the nearby thrust faults over the inter-seismic phase. Mass transfers induced by surface processes in general, during continuous or short-lived and intense events, represent a prominent mechanism for inter-seismic stress loading of faults near the surface. Such stresses are probably sufficient to trigger shallow seismicity or promote the rupture of deep continental earthquakes up to the surface.},

	abstract = {Under the background of increasingly scarce ore worldwide and increasingly fierce market competition, developing the mining industry could be strongly restricted. Intelligent ore sorting equipment not only improves ore use and enhances the economic benefits of enterprises but also increases the ore grade and lessens the grinding cost and tailings production. However, long-term research on intelligent ore sorting equipment found that the factors affecting sorting efficiency mainly include ore information identification technology, equipment sorting actuator, and information processing algorithm. The high precision, strong anti-interference capability, and high speed of these factors guarantee the separation efficiency of intelligent ore sorting equipment. Color ore sorter, X-ray ore transmission sorter, dual-energy X-ray transmission ore sorter, X-ray fluorescence ore sorter, and near-infrared ore sorter have been successfully developed in accordance with the different characteristics of minerals while ensuring the accuracy of equipment sorting and improving the equipment sorting efficiency. With the continuous improvement of mine automation level, the application of online element rapid analysis technology with high speed, high precision, and strong anti-interference capability in intelligent ore sorting equipment will become an inevitable trend of equipment development in the future. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, transient γ neutron activation analysis, online Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques will promote the development of ore sorting equipment. In addition, the improvement and joint application of additional high-speed and high-precision operation algorithms (such as peak area, principal component analysis, artificial neural network, partial least squares, and Monte Carlo library least squares methods) are an essential part of the development of intelligent ore sorting equipment in the future.},

Ore sorting is a class of technologies that offers potential solutions to these problems by identifying the metal values in a run-of-mine stream and separating the stones containing valuable mineralization from barren stones. This separation reduces the amount of material that must be processed to produce a given amount of value added metal, which has significant impact on the total mine and plant economics. To date, ore sorting has been studied extensively and several technologies have been identified as suitable for industrial application; however, very little quantitative discussion has been made about the impact of these technologies. Dual-energy X-ray transmission has been used to sort ore from different mines, and an analysis identifying the economic impact of these results is presented. Significant energy savings in milling have been realized, and capital and operating cost advantages to using ore sorting have been identified.},

	abstract = {San Rafael is the largest underground tin mining operation in the world. The main methods for processing the ore are gravity separation and flotation. In 2016 a new addition to the plant was an X-ray transmission (XRT)-based ore sorting island. The objective was to reject waste from a marginal development waste dump, and it is now also treating low grade material from the underground mine. XRT sorting discriminates particles on a planar projection of the density of matter attenuating X-ray radiation. Physical separation is achieved by means of an array of high speed air jets. The feed grade of approximately 0.6\% tin is concentrated to 2.8\% tin in the product at recovery of 90\% in about 19\% mass yield to product. This enriched product fraction from the sensor-based ore sorting plant feeds into the main plant. The plant, which is designed for 3600 tonnes per day, went into operation in 2016. The total capital expenditures of 24 M\$ US were paid back within 4 months. The projected contribution to the production of refined tin for the year 2017 was 6000 tonnes. In summary, the positive impacts were:–Value added from previously sub-economic waste that can be mined with lower costs.–Increase of productivity in the main wet sections of the plant.–Reduction in cut-off grade and increase in reserves.–Reduction of environmental impacts.The paper describes the project from concept, through the development phase, including test work confirming feasibility, to a discussion of operational data and includes shared experiences from operation and maintenance.},

	abstract = {Sensor-based sorting is increasingly used for the concentration of ores. To assess the sorting performance for a specific ore type, the raw materials industry currently conducts trial-and-error batch tests. In this study, a new methodology to assess the potential of hyperspectral visible to near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) sensors, combined with machine-learning routines to improve the sorting potential evaluation, is presented. The methodology is tested on two complex ores. The first is a tin ore in which cassiterite—the target mineral—is variable in grain size, heterogeneously distributed and has no diagnostic response in the VNIR-SWIR range of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, cassiterite is intimately associated with SWIR active minerals, such as chlorite and fluorite, which can be used as proxies for its presence. The second case study consists of a copper-gold porphyry, where copper occurs mainly in chalcopyrite, bornite, covellite and chalcocite, while gold is present as inclusions in the copper minerals and in pyrite. Machine-learning techniques such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine applied to the hyperspectral data predict excellent sorting results in terms of grade and recovery. The approach can be adjusted to optimize sorting for a variety of ore types and thus could increase the attractivity of VNIR-SWIR sensor sorting in the minerals industry.},

Possible applications include the rejection of barren material from mill feed, the rejection of pebbles in the SABC circuit or the recovery of valuable material from low grade stockpiles. It is recognized that XRF is a surface measurement that can detect copper but depending on several operational conditions, such as the orientation of the particle or mineral texture, the sensor spot may not see the copper. However, XRF also provides information about the concentrations of a range of elements in minerals that are associated with copper mineralization which can improve sorting. The study described herein is aimed at improving XRF sensor-based sorting by the introduction of logistics regression (LR)- and support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning approaches. To solve the collinearity and dimensionality issues in the input variables, the authors propose a combined approach of principal component analysis (PCA) and stepwise regression to extract the significant features. The combined PCA and stepwise regression approach is novel and has shown to be very effective for dimensionality reduction of the XRF spectrum data. By applying the ROC and AUC), the LR and SVM models are compared. Results showed that the LR model with the AUC of 0.847 outperforms the SVM with kernel functions with respect to classification accuracy; especially for data sets with a small number of features. The improved classification accuracy should benefit the economic performance of the particle sorting system.},

The technique allows for the early detection and diversion of sub-economic material by sensor-diverter systems before milling, thereby improving mill feed quality and reducing environmental impact. Grade heterogeneity in ore and sensor capability to measure grade accurately are prerequisites to applying bulk ore sorting. The technical synergy between the responses of multiple bulk ore sorting technologies can aid in taking full advantage of the grade heterogeneity existing in sorter feed while providing accurate and precise grade measurements. This study is aimed at quantitatively demonstrating the potential benefits of a conceptual strategy of integrating the responses from two sensor technologies for bulk ore sorting of copper porphyry deposits. Results show that a more significant enhancement in the Net Smelter Return (NSR) of the ore can be achieved by the simultaneous employment of the magnetic resonance (MR) and prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) sensors compared to the bulk ore sorting scenarios in which the sensor technologies are utilized separately. Results are encouraging and can prompt the collaboration of sensor manufacturers and mining companies to prove the actual value of the presented concept by performing on-site trials.},

This paper presents an ore-sorting algorithm based on image processing and machine learning that is able to classify rocks from a gold and silver mine based on their grade. The algorithm is composed of four main stages: (1) image segmentation and partition, (2) color and texture feature extraction, (3) sub-image classiﬁcation using neural networks, and (4) a voting system to determine the overall class of the rock. The algorithm was trained using images of rocks that a geologist manually classiﬁed according to their mineral content and then was validated using a different set of rocks analyzed in a laboratory to determine their gold and silver grades. The proposed method achieved a Matthews correlation coefﬁcient of 0.961 points, higher than other classiﬁcation algorithms based on support vector machines and convolutional neural networks, and a processing time under 44 ms, promising for real-time ore sorting applications.},

	abstract = {Sensor-based sorting has had a wide range of industrial use in automating and speeding up the process which requires substances or objects to be segregated from each other. The high demand for goods including raw materials, food, minerals, and waste recycling has increased the pressure for high-speed sorting. The first part of this paper presents a comprehensive theoretical and practical survey and comparison of current sorting methods relying on the use of the electromagnetic spectrum. Sorting methods are classified among other things, which portion of the EM spectrum is it, background noise rejection capacity, sample size limitations, sample chemistry limitations, sample surface cleanliness, spatial resolution capacity, spectral resolution, and feed rate limitations. The analysis focuses on color or visible light sorting, gamma-ray sorting, infra-red sorting, x-ray transmission-based sorting and x-ray fluorescence sorting, coupling the findings to the classification criteria outlined. We see a need to define a universal sorting scheme that will in general be applied to most sorting tasks. To do this, the final part of this paper re-looks at the x-ray transmission and x-ray fluorescence sorting scheme in line with the established limitations and proposes a dual x-ray transmission and fluorescence method to mitigate the challenge affecting the different schemes.},

However, the related research on deep learning-based mineral image classification has not systematically considered the models for multi-coal and multi-class sorting. Additionally, the universal CNNs model for multi-coal image classification has not been proposed. Given the above problems, combined with deep learning and transfer learning and based on VGG Net, Inception Net, and Res Net, this study builds four CNNs models with different depth and structure for multi-coal and multi-class image classification. Finally, we take anthracite, gas coal, coking coal as the research objects and propose a universal CNNs model suitable for multi-coal and multi-class sorting. Moreover, with the Channel Visualization map, Heatmap, Gard-CAM map, and Guided Backpropagation map, the operational processes of CNNs model in coal image recognition and classification are revealed, and the features that affect the classification weights are analyzed.},

Deep learning, as one of the outstanding branches of machine learning, makes it possible to design, deploy and apply the high-performance vision models, and the architecture represented by convolutional neural networks again improves the accuracy and speed of mineral sorting. Based on this, we carefully review and survey the research and applications of deep learning in digital mineral image classification between 2017 and 2022, and state the evolution and innovation of it in terms of mineral types, data qualities, and model architectures. The scope considered in this review is to predict one class label for the entire image rather than the segmentation task of pixel-by-pixel classification.

	abstract = {Although various articles have reviewed the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in froth flotation (summarized in this article), other unit operations for mineral concentration in mineral processing have not been reviewed. Thus, this article reviews AI application in various unit operations for mineral concentration. Because unit operations for mineral concentration deal with yields not necessarily linearly correlated with input variables, subsequent yield prediction using AI can add value to their control. The current applications of AI have neglected fundamental variables (e.g., particle agglomeration, particle magnetic susceptibility, particle wettability, particle surface charge, and particle Hamaker constant) as inputs for prediction. Instrumentation and industrial simplicity have hindered the consideration of those variables because validation is required. There are kind learning (repeated patterns and high accuracy measurements) and wicked learning (continuously novel patterns and noise in measurements) environments, which are suitable and challenging for machine learning, respectively. Kind learning environments were largely used for the applications of AI. Furthermore, flow can be captured by AI (e.g., neural networks) to attempt to control drag and mixing using synthetic jet type actuators in equipment (shaking tables, fluidized beds, or vessels). Thus, future applications of AI should consider these points.},

The classical linear methods of processing the information no longer suffice and thus machine learning methods for extracting the chemical information from Raman and SERS experiments have been implemented recently. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of the most common machine learning techniques employed in Raman, a guideline for new users to implement machine learning in their data analysis process, and an overview of modern applications of machine learning in Raman and SERS.},

This paper demonstrates an extremely fast and accurate method for identifying unknown ore mineral samples by portable Raman spectroscopy from the RRUFF database. Resampling and background subtraction procedures are used to eliminate the influence of the Raman spectrometer and fluorescence scattering. For the complex mineral spectral classification task, a multi-scale dilated convolutional attention network is designed. In addition, to investigate the identification performance of our method, several machine learning and two basic deep learning models, including k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), cosine similarity, extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost), Alexnet and ResNet 18, are also developed on the mineral spectra database and applied for mineral identification. Comparative studies show that our CNN network outperforms other models with state-of-the-art results, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 89.51\% and a top-3 accuracy of 96.54\%. The function of each module and the explanations of the feature extraction in our CNN network were analyzed by ablation experiments and the Grad-CAM algorithm. The identification of ore mineral samples also proves the outstanding performance of our method. In conclusion, the proposed novel approach that exploits the advantages of portable Raman spectroscopy and a deep learning method is promising for rapidly identifying ore mineral samples.},

In this project, we apply machine learning techniques to improve mineral identification using the latter group. We test the effects of common spectrum preprocessing steps, such as intensity normalization, smoothing, and squashing, and found that the last is superior. Next, we demonstrate that full-spectrum matching algorithms exhibit excellent performance in classification tasks, without requiring time-intensive dimensionality reduction or model training. This class of algorithms supports both vector and trajectory input formats, exploiting all available spectral information. By combining these insights, we find that optimal mineral spectrum matching performance can be achieved using careful preprocessing and a weighted-neighbors classifier based on a vector similarity metric.

Over the last decade a range of automated mineralogy technologies have arisen from the global mining industry and are being increasingly used in other branches of geology. These technologies, based on scanning electron microscopy with linked energy dispersive spectrometers, have the potential to revolutionise how we quantify mineralogy.

	abstract = {Important decisions in local agricultural policy and practice often hinge on the soil’s chemical composition. Raman spectroscopy offers a rapid noninvasive means to quantify the constituents of complex organic systems. But the application of Raman spectroscopy to soils presents a multifaceted challenge due to organic/mineral compositional complexity and spectral interference arising from overwhelming fluorescence. The present work compares methodologies with the capacity to help overcome common obstacles that arise in the analysis of soils. We created conditions representative of these challenges by combining varying proportions of six amino acids commonly found in soils with fluorescent bentonite clay and coarse mineral components. Referring to an extensive data set of Raman spectra, we compare the performance of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and partial least-squares regression (PLSR) multivariate models for amino acid composition. Strategies employing volume-averaged spectral sampling and data preprocessing algorithms improve the predictive power of these models. Our average test R2 for PLSR models exceeds 0.89 and approaches 0.98, depending on the complexity of the matrix, whereas CNN yields an R2 range from 0.91 to 0.97, demonstrating that classic PLSR and CNN perform comparably, except in cases where the signal-to-noise ratio of the organic component is very low, whereupon CNN models outperform. Artificially isolating two of the most prevalent obstacles in evaluating the Raman spectra of soils, we have characterized the effect of each obstacle on the performance of machine learning models in the absence of other complexities. These results highlight important considerations and modeling strategies necessary to improve the Raman analysis of organic compounds in complex mixtures in the presence of mineral spectral components and significant fluorescence.},

Our study shows that machine learning methods, specifically artificial neural networks, can be trained using spectral data acquired by in situ Raman spectroscopy in order to accurately distinguish among key minerals for characterizing the composition of igneous rocks. These minerals include olivine, quartz, plagioclase, potassium feldspar, mica, and several pyroxenes. On average, our classifier performed with 83 percent accuracy. Quartz and olivine, as well as the pyroxenes, were classified with 100 percent accuracy. In addition to using traditional features such as the location of spectral bands and their shapes, our automated mineral classifier was able to incorporate fluorescence patterns, which are not as easily perceived by humans, into its classification scheme. The latter was able to improve the classification accuracy and is an example of the robustness of our classifier.},

	abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is often used for the composition determination and rapid classification of materials because it can reflect the molecular information of materials. Its accuracy mainly depends on the performance of the classification algorithm. In addition to classic machine learning classifiers such as support vector machines and k-nearest neighbor, 1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also been applied to recognize Raman spectra. However, most of the research on 1D CNNs is still in the shallow, simple structure of the network model, and its application scope is only for the classification of a few classes. Therefore, this paper proposes a spectral data classification model based on a 1D deep CNN for classifying and recognizing hundreds of classes. We used the RRUFF Raman spectrum database containing many mineral samples to construct two sub-datasets, which were used to evaluate the classification effect of the model from different perspectives without data enhancement. The experimental results show that the model has a high recognition accuracy for data sets with hundreds of classes and sufficient samples. Compared with the classic machine learning classification algorithm and the 1D CNN models proposed by other scholars, our model has higher recognition accuracy and better performance and has better applicability to datasets with thousands of classes and imbalanced class distribution.},

	abstract = {NASA's Mars 2020 and ESA's ExoMars will collect Raman measurements in dusty field conditions obscuring underlying rocks. This presents a challenge for remote Raman measurements at distances where mechanical or ablative sample cleaning is not straightforward. Historically, probing broad lithostratigraphic suites has been thwarted by the need for pristine targets and high-quality spectra. We provide a means of identifying Raman spectra of common rock-forming silicate, carbonate, and sulfate minerals under low signal-to-noise-ratios, Mars-like conditions using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained on the Machine Learning Raman Open Data set data set with 500,000+ Raman spectra of hand samples/powder mixtures (5,000+ spectra/mineral class). Diversity in sample microtopography, orientation, and crystallinity simulated varying laser focuses and spectral quality, and no traditional spectral preprocessing such as cosmic ray or baseline removal was employed. The CNN identified low-intensity Raman scatterers (micas and amphiboles), mixed minerals, and distinguished between mineral endmembers with +99\% success. We present among the first known implementations of “big data” machine learning using varied, high-volume Raman spectral datasets. The pattern recognition abilities of CNNs can facilitate scientist Raman spectral interpretation on Earth and autonomous rover decision-making on planets like Mars; increasing scientific yield, correcting human classification errors, reducing the need for thorough target dust removal during evaluative measurements, and streamlining the data communications pipeline—saving time and resources. This study examines an end-to-end development process for creating a deep learning algorithm sensitive to varieties of Raman spectra and provides guidelines for CNN model development at the interface of Raman spectroscopy, deep learning, and planetary science.},

However, instruments onboard these missions are not similarly equipped with automated science analysis classifiers onboard rovers, which can further improve scientific yield and autonomy. Here, we present both single- and multi-mineral autonomous classifiers integrated using the results from a co-registered dual-band Raman spectrometer. This instrument consecutively irradiates the same spot size on the same sample using two excitation lasers of different wavelengths (532 nm and 785 nm). We identify the presence of mineral groups: pyroxene, olivine, potassium feldspar, quartz, mica, gypsum, and plagioclase, in 191 rocks. These minerals are among the major rock forming mineral groups and so their presence or absence within a sample is key for understanding rock composition and the environment in which it formed. We present machine learning methods used to train classifiers and leverage the multiple modalities of the dual-band Raman spectrometer. When testing on a novel sample set for single-mineral classification, we show accuracy scores up to 100\% (varying by mineral), with a total classification rate (over all minerals) of 91\%. When testing on a novel set of samples for multi-mineral classification, we show accuracy scores up to 96\%, with a total classification rate of 73\%. We end with several hypothesis tests, that demonstrate that dual-band Raman spectroscopy is more robust and improves the scientific yield for mineral classification over single-band spectroscopy, especially when combined with our multimodal neural network.},

	abstract = {Robust classification methods are vital to the successful implementation of many material characterization techniques, particularly where large databases exist. In this paper, we demonstrate an extremely fast classification method for the identification of mineral mixtures in Raman spectroscopy using the large RRUFF database. However, this method is equally applicable to other techniques meeting the large database criteria, these including laser-induced breakdown, X-ray diffraction, and mass spectroscopy methods. Classification of these multivariate datasets can be challenging due in part to the various obscuring features inherently present within the underlying dataset and in part to the volume and variety of information known a priori. Some of the more specific challenges include the observation of mixtures with overlapping spectral features, the use of large databases (i.e., the number of predictors far outweighs the number of observations), the use of databases that contain groups of correlated spectra, and the ever present, clouding contaminants of noise, undesired background, and spectrometer artifacts. Although many existing classification algorithms attempt to address these problems individually, not many address them as a whole. Here, we apply a multistage approach, which leverages well-established constrained regression techniques, to overcome these challenges. Our modifications to conventional algorithm implementations are shown to increase speed and performance of the classification process. Unlike many other techniques, our method is able to rapidly classify mixtures while simultaneously preserving sparsity. It is easily implemented, has very few tuning parameters, does not require extensive parameter training, and does not require data dimensionality reduction prior to classification.},

	abstract = {Mineral identification is a basic skill in geological studies, and is useful for characterizing rocks and tracing diagenesis and mineralization processes. Traditional methods of observation under a microscope are subject to many complex factors such as the limitations of resolution and magnification, so they are poor in qualitative analysis, and inefficient. With the expansion of geological prospecting, it is necessary to provide information for all minerals, pores and trace elements in rocks. So, mineral identification has started to rely on advanced microbeam mineral analysis techniques. This paper summarizes the common mineral analysis techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Automated mineralogy (AM) systems. These microbeam technologies now approach a semi-automated analysis process, and most of these methods mainly detect the chemical composition of the mineral, rather than the mineral's optical characteristics which are the most basic properties of minerals. Therefore, this study proposes a method that can use mineral's optical features for automatic classification, mineral recognition based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and face recognition technology. The feasibility, research status and outlook of this method are also discussed. The proposed method uses convolution neural network technology to automatically extract the optical characteristics of minerals for mineral identification. Successful application of these techniques will have profound application value by reducing the cost and time needed to process and identify minerals.},

	abstract = {The three main serpentine minerals, chrysotile, lizardite, and antigorite, form in various geological settings and have different chemical compositions and rheological properties. The accurate identification of serpentine minerals is thus of fundamental importance to understanding global geochemical cycles and the tectonic evolution of serpentine-bearing rocks. However, it is challenging to distinguish specific serpentine species solely based on geochemical data obtained by traditional analytical techniques. Here, we apply machine learning approaches to classify serpentine minerals based on their chemical compositions alone. Using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, we trained a classifier model (overall accuracy of 87.2\%) that is capable of distinguishing between low-temperature (chrysotile and lizardite) and high-temperature (antigorite) serpentines mainly based on their SiO 2 , NiO, and Al 2 O 3 contents. We also utilized a k -means model to demonstrate that the tectonic environment in which serpentine minerals form correlates with their chemical compositions. Our results obtained by combining these classification and clustering models imply the increase of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 contents and the decrease of NiO content during the transformation from low- to high-temperature serpentine (i.e., lizardite and chrysotile to antigorite) under greenschist–blueschist conditions. These correlations can be used to constrain mass transfer and the surrounding environments during the subduction of hydrated oceanic crust.},

	abstract = {Electropulse treatments employ a series of high-voltage discharges to break rock into small fragments. As these methods are particularly suited to fracturing hard brittle rocks, electropulse treatments can serve to enhance or substitute for more traditional mechanical approaches to drilling and processing of these materials. Nevertheless, while these treatments have the potential to improve hard-rock operations, the coupled electro-mechanical processes responsible for damaging the rock are poorly described. The lack of accurate models for these processes increases the difficulty of designing, controlling and optimizing tools that employ electropulse treatments and limits their range of application. This paper describes a new modeling method for studying electropulse treatments in geotechnical operations. The multiphysics model simulates the passage of the pulse, electrical breakdown in the rock, and the mechanical response at the grain-scale. It also accounts for the contributions from different minerals and porosities, allowing the effect of material composition to be considered. In so doing, it provides a means to investigate the different physical and operational factors influencing electropulse treatments.},

The high voltage pulse (HVP) is a novel technology with the potential to be applied in the mineral processing industries which provides enhanced liberation, pre-weakening and pre-concentration benefits for raw material. This paper reviews in detail the HVP working principles and the work devoted to the aforementioned three applications. In addition, major challenges affecting the industrial uptake of the HVP technique are also discussed in the context of HVP fragmentation specific energy consumption, machine wear, cost of water processing and machine throughput limitations. HVP selectivity in between particles is accentuated in this review and believed to have good prospects for industrial uptake due to its capability to achieve selective fragmentation and selective weakening effects for the mineralised particles. Finally, the paper is enclosed with an outlook of HVP future development.},

In a comminution circuit, there are several levers that can be taken advantage of, such as the ore competency, feed grade, and particle size. By varying these process parameters, the operations can achieve energy savings. However, operations must be able to balance both the energy savings and the costs associated with the various unit operations. Microwave pre-treatment has several pathways of energy saving: reducing the ore competency, increasing the liberation, and improving the ore sortability. And these pathways can also bring economic benefits to the operations at different levels. This paper will discuss the impacts of these parameters regarding the energy consumption and economics. The relative combinations of various levers, in order to maximize the economic and energy savings, are presented.},

	abstract = {Previous research at low power levels has shown that kimberlite ores undergo fracturing during microwave treatment. However, a detailed study of the application of high-power microwave-assisted comminution is lacking. In this paper, the microwave heating behaviour of a volcaniclastic kimberlite (VK) was investigated at both the bench and the pilot scales. Firstly, to elucidate the heating mechanisms, permittivity measurements were combined with thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry studies. Secondly, bench-scale microwave (BMW) testing confirmed that the VK was very microwave responsive with significant macrofracturing, especially at a coarser particle size. Thirdly, preliminary pilot-scale microwave (150 kW) tests were carried out in both batch processing (BP) and continuous processing (CP) manners. The BP tests experienced macrofracturing, while the CP tests did not. These results demonstrated the importance of residence time and hence specific energy input. Fourthly, timed SAG mill grinding tests were performed on the following samples: as-received (AR), BMW, BP, and CP. Both the particle size distributions and the quantity of fines ({\textless}850 μm) were determined. Compared to the AR sample, the BMW and the BP samples generated more fines, while the CP sample yielded a coarser particle size distribution. Thus, the amount of fines generated was related to the total microwave energy input. Finally, more research is planned both to develop an improved understanding of the heating mechanisms and to enhance the process at the pilot scale.},

However, there is a dearth of data on the permittivities, of not only the ores and the concentrates, but also the minerals that comprise the ores. In the present research, the permittivities of selected hydroxide minerals were determined using the cavity perturbation technique as a function of both temperature and frequency. The behaviours of the permittivities were interpreted using both thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and thermodynamic modelling. The water in these minerals, in its various forms, makes a significant contribution to the permittivities. Also, generally, the higher iron-bearing hydroxides have higher permittivities than the magnesium silicates or aluminosilicates. It is shown that the permittivities of the hydroxide minerals are low, but the hydroxyl ion makes a significant contribution. The effect of frequency is more pronounced both during dehydroxylation and at high temperatures and, in both cases, is attributed to increases in the ac conductivity.},

	abstract = {The mining of ultramafic ores is required to meet society’s continued demand for nickel. These deposits, however, are difficult to process due to their high serpentine content. Serpentine, a gangue mineral, increases slurry viscosity, slime-coats the valuable Ni-bearing mineral pentlandite, and reports to and dilutes the froth during flotation via the formation of bubble-fibre aggregates. Microwave pre-treatment can be used to convert the serpentine gangue to olivine, which should improve ore processing. However, the fundamental microwave properties and heating behaviour of ultramafic ores must be understood to develop a robust process. Microwave heating curves were developed for, and high temperature permittivity analysis was conducted on, two ultramafic nickel ores (Pipe and OK ore). Subsequently, TGA/DSC (thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry) and HTXRD (high-temperature x-ray diffraction) tests, along with a thermodynamic analysis using FactSage 7.3, were done to explain the heating behaviours and permittivity data. An unusual peak in the permittivity data was detected at 950 °C for the Pipe ore with both increasing and decreasing temperature; however, no phase transitions were detected in the TGA/DSC analysis. HTXRD of the Pipe ore revealed the presence of heazlewoodite at higher temperatures (950 to 1100 °C). Thermodynamic modeling of the Pipe ore system suggests that melting at higher temperatures is responsible for the decrease in the permittivities of this ore. To mitigate the melting and clumping of the ore particles, it is necessary to ensure that the processing temperature does not exceed 800 °C during microwave treatment. The OK ore, which contained less microwave response minerals than the Pipe ore, reached a maximum temperature of 500 °C after only 5 min of heating time, and therefore overheating was not an issue.},

The microwave heating properties of pyrrhotite tailings are explored in this paper through microwave heating and permittivity tests. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were also performed to interpret the permittivity data, and the distribution of phases within the microwave treated material was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. In general, pyrrhotite heats very well upon exposure to microwave radiation. The mass loss appears to be governed by the sulphur content and the extent of heating seems to be influenced by the Ni content. The removal of silicate impurities by froth flotation had little impact on the heating behaviour.},

Over the last decade, high temperature permittivity measurements have been performed on various ores using the cavity perturbation technique.

Therefore, the exploitation of low-grade ultramafic nickel ores is of increasing interest. Processing these deposits, however, is a challenge, due to the high serpentine content. Serpentine minerals are anisotropic, increase the viscosity of ore slurries, dilute the concentrate, and slime-coat the valuable nickel mineral pentlandite. Microwave pre-treatment of ultramafic nickel ores has been proposed to convert the serpentine to olivine, reduce the viscosity of the ore slurry, improve ore grindability and mineral liberation, and reduce the overall energy requirements of processing. To optimize the process, an understanding of the microwave heating properties of ultramafic nickel ores and constituent minerals is necessary. The microwave heating of serpentine and olivine, the primary components of ultramafic nickel ores, is explored in this paper. Microwave heating tests and high-temperature microwave properties (real and imaginary permittivity) analysis were performed. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests were also completed to explain the permittivity data. Serpentine responded more readily to microwaves than olivine and the maximum temperatures achieved were 216 °C and 57 °C, respectively. Serpentine did not reach the temperature required for dehydroxylation (600-700 °C). The real and imaginary permittivities for serpentine and olivine varied with temperature, but overall were low, indicating these minerals cannot be expected to heat well on their own upon exposure to microwave radiation. A microwave susceptor is required for the serpentine in ultramafic nickel ores to reach dehydroxylation temperatures. It is hypothesized that the small quantities of pyrrhotite and magnetite present in ultramafic ores play this role.},

Expensive and time-consuming lab experiments are not affordable in fully characterizing material behavior for samples with all possible attributes. In this paper, we present data-driven modeling of the cyclic axial compression and ring-shear stress–strain behavior for granular biomass materials with different moisture contents and mean particle sizes. Laboratory characterization data of milled pine samples, with a mean particle size of 2, 4, and 6 mm and a moisture content of 0\%, 20\%, and 40\%, were employed to train two machine learning (ML) models independently. The sequential model takes a sequence of loading history into Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and predicts the next step of strain/stress with a feed-forward neural network. In contrast, the incremental model takes only the current state to predict the stiffness/compliance coefficient and compute the stress/strain increment. Both models account for material variations in particle sizes and moisture content. After training, both models demonstrate their high efficiency and accuracy in predicting the mechanical behavior of samples with a diverse set of unseen material properties, augmenting the existing laboratory data set. They also effectively capture the underlying physics, which involves increased compressibility as moisture content rises and a linear relationship between applied compression and shear strength. This effort established the foundation for comprehensive data-driven constitutive modeling tailored for unconventional granular materials.},

This paper is devoted to evaluating the cracking property and brittleness of the Gonghe granite under high-temperature true triaxial compression conditions through a series of laboratory tests. Thermal–mechanical coupled true triaxial compression tests were conducted on Gonghe granite samples under four representative temperatures (20 °C, 120 °C, 180 °C, and 240 °C) and three different minimum (5, 10, and 30 MPa) and intermediate (40, 60, and 75 MPa) principal stresses that correspond to the in-situ conditions of Gonghe geothermal reservoir. The strength, deformation, and cracking characteristics of the Gonghe granite are quantitatively evaluated from macro- to micro-scales based on the experimental results. Meanwhile, a novel brittleness index evaluation method considering both energy and failure surface roughness is proposed to accurately assess the brittleness strength of the Gonghe granite. We found that the strength of Gonghe granite is reduced by more than 20\% when the temperature increases from room temperature to 240 °C. Higher temperature contributes to a smoother fracture surface and reduced brittleness of the Gonghe granite under thermal–mechanical coupled true triaxial compression. Our findings provide new insights for brittleness evaluation of the Gonghe granite formation and assist in efficient wells drilling design of enhanced geothermal systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Assuming that the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) drastically reduces rock permeability, potentially exploitable geothermal resources (permeability: {\textgreater}10−16 m2) consisting of supercritical water or superheated steam (≥{\textasciitilde}400 °C) could occur only in rocks with unusually high transition temperatures such as basalt. However, fracturing is possible even in ductile rocks, and some permeability-depth relations proposed for the continental crust show no drastic permeability reduction due to the BDT. Here we introduce our published results of permeability measurements on high-temperature fractured granite, suggesting that the BDT is not the first-order control on rock permeability, and that potentially exploitable resources may occur in granitic rocks with much lower BDT temperatures ({\textasciitilde}360 °C) that comprise the bulk of the continental crust. We additionally introduce our published results of hydraulic fracturing experiments on granite from subcritical/brittle to supercritical/ductile conditions, confirming the possibility of well stimulation to create excellent fracture patterns that should allow the effective extraction of thermal energy in the superhot geothermal environments of ≥{\textasciitilde}400 °C.1. Introduction. The IDDP-1 well in Iceland found rhyolitic magma at a depth of {\textasciitilde}2 km, and well tests showed flow rates of up to 50 kg/s at temperatures of up to 440 °C (Ingason et al., 2014). At such high enthalpies of {\textasciitilde}3.2 MJ/kg, sustained flow rates of {\textasciitilde}30 kg/s could produce {\textasciitilde}20 MWe. This finding generated interest in the possibility of extracting energy from superhot geothermal environments of ≥{\textasciitilde}400 °C. On the other hand, it has been proposed that permeability decreases drastically due to the brittle-ductile transition, BDT (Hayba and Ingebritsen, 1997). Assuming that the permeability is drastically reduced due to the BDT, potentially exploitable geothermal resources (permeability: {\textgreater}10−16 m2) consisting of supercritical water or superheated steam (≥{\textasciitilde}400 °C) can form only in rocks with unusually high transition temperatures (≥450 °C), such as basalt (Scott et al., 2015). However, even rocks that are ductile in compression can be brittle in extension (Heard, 1960), and evidence of intensive melt-driven hydraulic fracturing in the middle crust beneath the BDT zone has been found in outcrops in Antarctica (Engvik et al., 2005). Moreover, some permeability-depth relations proposed for the continental crust show no drastic permeability reduction due to the BDT (Manning and Ingebritsen, 1999). Therefore, potentially exploitable geothermal resources in superhot geothermal environments may be more widespread than has been assumed.},

	abstract = {This study elucidates the possibility of CO2 injection-induced formation of a complex cloud-fracture network (CFN) in granite, along with shearing (shear slip) of natural pre-existing fractures under conventional ({\textasciitilde} 150–300 °C) and superhot ({\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 400 °C) geothermal conditions, potentially providing additional connecting flow paths between the stimulated natural fractures. Here, we conduct a set of experiments under triaxial stress states at 150 °C and 450 °C on cylindrical granite samples containing a sawcut (representing a natural fracture) inclined 45° from the sample’s axis. CO2 injection induced dynamic shear slip on the sawcut, with higher slip velocities at 150 °C owing to the higher elasticity of the rock than that at 450 °C. The lower viscosity of CO2 also allowed it to more uniformly pressurize the sawcut, resulting in higher slip velocities and slip displacements compared with those based on water injection in the 150 °C experiments. This implies that under conventional geothermal conditions, CO2 injection can stimulate the same volume of rock as that of water injection at lower injection-well pressures. The CFNs then formed via CO2 injection at pressures similar to those predicted by the Griffith failure criterion as the sawcut shear slip progressed at both experimental temperatures. The experiments also revealed potential challenges associated with CO2 injection in naturally fractured geothermal environments, such as narrow aperture CFNs, owing to decreasing differential stress during their formation; all these factors should be addressed in future research.},

	abstract = {Recent researches have proposed the use of enhanced geothermal system reservoirs consisting of dense networks of microfractures, created by hydraulic and/or thermal fracturing in superhot/supercritical geothermal environments, because of their suitability for thermal energy harvesting. During fracturing and energy extraction, the fracture networks are exposed to cooling due to the injection of cold fluid into the reservoirs. Previous studies showed such cooling enhanced reservoir permeability in conventional geothermal environments. However, the cooling may result in a higher risk of seismicity, owing to decreased normal stress on the fractures. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether cooling-induced permeability enhancement and a higher risk of seismicity occurs within networks of microfractures which consist of numerous interconnected microfractures at various orientations to the in situ triaxial stress. Thus, no dominant fractures have the possibility to cause permeability enhancement/induced seismicity. In this study, results are presented for borehole cooling experiments on a dense network of microfractures in granite, at 400 °C, under true triaxial stress. Permeability and acoustic emissions were measured with decreases in borehole temperature (up to {\textasciitilde} 90 °C). Results showed that permeability increased with increasing temperature drop at relatively low stress levels (15 and 20 MPa). The permeability enhancement occurred without intensive failure, and was reversible. However, permeability was almost constant at a higher stress level (65 MPa). Results showed that permeability enhancement required a thermal stress equivalent to the mean stress, so that the normal stress was reduced to near-zero, for a considerable amount of the microfractures. Additionally, the permeability of dense microfracture networks can be increased by cooling primarily through thermo-elastic deformation (without intensive failure), which may be useful to compensate for the reduction in injectivity due to cooling-induced fluid property changes.},

This work demonstrates the formation of a network of permeable microfractures densely distributed throughout the entire rock body, representing a so-called cloud-fracture network. Fracturing was found to be initiated at a relatively low injection pressure between the intermediate and minimum principal stresses and propagated in accordance with the distribution of preexisting microfractures, independent of the directions of the principal stresses. This study confirms the possibility of well stimulation to create excellent fracture patterns that should allow the effective extraction of thermal energy.},

Here we report a series of numerical simulations of fluid flow and heat transfer around magmatic intrusions which reveal key features of the natural thermal and hydraulic structures of high-enthalpy geothermal systems. We explore the effect of key geologic controls, such as host rock permeability, the emplacement depth and geometry of the intrusion, and temperature-dependent permeability near the intrusion, on the depth and extent of boiling zones, the number and spatial configuration of upflow plumes, and how these aspects evolve over the systems’ lifetime. Host rock permeability is a primary control on the general structure, temperature distribution and extent of boiling zones, as systems with high permeability (≥10−14m2) show shallow boiling zones restricted to ≤1km depth, while intermediate permeability (∼10−15m2) systems display vertically extensive boiling zones reaching from the surface to the intrusion. Intrusion emplacement depth is a further control, as intermediate permeability systems driven by an intrusion at ≥3km depth only show boiling above 1km. If a cooling intrusion becomes permeable at temperatures significantly in excess of the critical temperature of water, the enthalpy of the upflow becomes high enough that systems with high permeability show vertically extensive boiling zones, and intermediate permeability systems spatially extensive zones of supercritical water near the intrusion. The development of multiple, spatially separated upflow plumes above a single intrusive body is characteristic of systems with high permeability and deep emplacement depth. Depending on the primary geologic controls, systems exhibit characteristic lateral and vertical gradients in pressure, temperature and enthalpy relative to the intrusive heat source which may aid in geothermal exploration and interpretation of field measurements.},

This was demonstrated by several deep geothermal drilling campaigns throughout the years, starting in the late 1970s. The interest in exploring supercritical resources is particularly strong, as it was revealed that one such well might significantly increase the production output and simultaneously decrease the need for drilling operations within a particular geothermal field. Deep drilling projects exploring supercritical resources such as these carried out in Iceland, Italy or Japan, where temperatures went significantly above the critical point and hostile geothermal fluids were produced, faced a variety of challenges during drilling operations and fluid production. The most critical of these exerted major thermally driven loads upon the cemented casing strings, leading to serious damages and eventually to well abandonment. This research presents an extensive literature search on failure modes of 20 wells from different high-enthalpy geothermal fields around the world, experiencing temperatures greater than the critical point of pure water and gives an overview of areas of improvements and potential solutions in regards to the drilling and well completion technology.},

The pore pressure is assumed hydrostatic. In hydrothermal systems the temperature is calculated assuming the boiling point condition at the speciﬁc pore pressure down to the reservoir. Beneath the reservoir it is assumed constant in convectively heated systems and following a constant temperature gradient in conductively heated systems. In Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) conductive heat transfer and constant temperature gradient are assumed. We present three application examples, considering simpliﬁed subsurface models to describe the geothermal systems beneath the production wells.

To examine their feasibility, we performed high-temperature (up to 1000 °C), high-pressure (130 MPa) triaxial experiments on granite (initially-intact and shock-cooled samples) in which we measured the evolution of porosity during deformation. Mechanical data and post-mortem microstuctural characterisation (X-ray computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy) indicate that (1) the failure mode was brittle up to 900 °C (shear fracture formation) but ductile at 1000 °C (no strain localisation); (2) only deformation up to 800 °C was dilatant; (3) deformation at 900 °C was brittle but associated with net compaction due to an increase in the efficiency of crystal plastic processes; (4) ductile deformation at 1000 °C was compactant; (5) thermally-shocking the granite did not influence strength or failure mode. Our data show that, while brittle behaviour increases porosity, porosity loss is associated with both ductile behaviour and transitional behaviour as the failure mode evolves from brittle to ductile. Extrapolating our data to geological strain rates suggests that the brittle-ductile transition occurs at a temperature of 400 ± 100 °C, and is associated with the limit of fluid circulation in the deep continental crust.},

However, tensile fracturing is possible even in ductile rocks, and some permeability–depth relations proposed for the continental crust show no drastic permeability reduction at the BDT. Here we present experimental results suggesting that the BDT is not the first-order control on rock permeability, and that potentially exploitable resources may occur in rocks with much lower BDT temperatures, such as the granitic rocks that comprise the bulk of the continental crust. We find that permeability behaviour for fractured granite samples at 350–500 °C under effective confining stress is characterized by a transition from a weakly stress-dependent and reversible behaviour to a strongly stress-dependent and irreversible behaviour at a specific, temperature-dependent effective confining stress level. This transition is induced by onset of plastic normal deformation of the fracture surface (elastic–plastic transition) and, importantly, causes no ‘jump’ in the permeability. Empirical equations for this permeability behaviour suggest that potentially exploitable resources exceeding 450 °C may form at depths of 2–6 km even in the nominally ductile crust.},

Here, we explore the complex permeability of rocks under supercritical conditions using mechanical data from a gas-based triaxial apparatus, high-resolution synchrotron post-mortem 3D imagery, and finite element modeling. We report a first order control of strain partitioning on permeability. In the brittle regime, strain localizes on permeable faults without necessarily increasing sample apparent permeability. In the semi-ductile regime, distributed strain increases permeability both in deformation bands and the bulk, leading to a more than tenfold permeability increase. This study challenges the belief that the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) marks a cutoff for fluid circulation in the crust, demonstrating that permeability can develop in deforming semi-ductile rocks.},

	abstract = {This article presents a simple method for coupling the equations for fluid and heat flow in a porous medium with a rock mechanics model based on a simplified Mohr–Coulomb yield criterion. The aim is to investigate the effects of introducing a brittle–ductile transition zone (BDTZ) into models of the large scale hydrology of systems like the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) in New Zealand. The coupling between fluid/heat flow and rock mechanics is only partial in that it assumes that the local strain rate and lithostatic pressure are known a priori. A simple empirical relationship between the permeabilities of rock in its brittle and ductile states is also assumed, which mimics the effect of slow thermal creep in closing fluid pathways by reducing the effective permeability. This model is first applied to a number of simple situations where large scale convection of groundwater occurs above a depth of 20-km. These examples demonstrate the formation of a horizontal brittle–ductile transition zone under conductive conditions with uniform strain, and how this responds to local changes in pressure, temperature and strain rate. The presence of low permeability below the BDTZ effectively defines the greatest depth to which groundwater can steadily penetrate, providing a feedback to these models which influences the transport of heat and mass on all the length scales. The TVZ provides inspiration for the second model setting. Localised sources of water and heat, modelled on magmatic sill-like structures at a depth of 10-km, induce a BDTZ which shallows from 14-km to less than 10-km, consistent with geophysical estimates in the TVZ. A common feature of the models is that strong downflows of surface water occur in permeable regions adjacent to the heat sources, which depress the BDTZ by several kilometres between the geothermal areas. Water with near-surface temperatures can thus exist at great depths in these regions. Lastly, the models imply that the geothermal areas in the TVZ probably do not occur directly above any localised heat source, but are instead displaced towards the centre of the TVZ rift.},

	abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing experiments were conducted at 200–450°C by injecting water into cylindrical granite samples containing a borehole at an initial effective confining pressure of 40 MPa. Intensive fracturing was observed at all temperatures, but the fracturing characteristics varied with temperature, perhaps due to differences in the water viscosity. At the lowest considered temperature (200°C), fewer fractures propagated linearly from the borehole, and the breakdown pressure was twice the confining pressure. However, these characteristics disappeared with increasing temperature; the fracture pattern shifted toward the formation of a greater number of shorter fractures over the entire body of the sample, and the breakdown pressure decreased greatly. Hydraulic fracturing significantly increased the permeability at all temperatures, and this permeability enhancement was likely to form a productive geothermal reservoir even at the highest considered temperature, which exceeded both the brittle-ductile transition temperature of granite and the critical temperature of water.},

The attenuation of tensile and compressive strength, and the microwave response mechanism of igneous rocks are studied. The results show that under microwave energy of 0–50 kJ, the tensile and compressive strengths of rock do not change significantly; however, above 50 kJ, they decrease rapidly. With increasing contents of Fe-rich minerals in rock, such as pyroxene, microwaves have a greater fracturing effect, which is manifested as rapid attenuations in tensile and compressive strength. The wave velocity damage factor and tensile strength damage factor of igneous rocks increase with the increase of microwave energy.},

	abstract = {Although metals are fundamental to the economy and human well-being, natural ore depletion is inevitable with the continuation of mining. Awareness of the importance of new developments in technologies to process natural ores and to recycle waste materials to obtain pure metals with high efficiency has been growing over time. The microwave-based furnace, which heats samples rapidly, uniformly and selectively, has recently been given more attention as an alternative to the conventional heating systems. However, the current progress of microwave technology for obtaining pure metals has not been fully monitored. This study reviews the extractive metallurgical approaches for obtaining pure metals by subjecting virgin materials and waste materials to the microwave heating method. In this paper, the principles of the microwave-based furnace to heat the samples are first summarized. Then, the studies of microwave-based pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical approaches to produce the virgin metals and to recycle metals are abridged. Finally, the limitations of current progress and the future prospects of microwave-based metallurgical technology are identified. A number of clear advantages of microwave irradiation emerged through the review process. The two most noteworthy advantages are that some materials difficult to reduce using conventional technology can be treated effectively using microwave irradiation, and microwave technology has the potential for a number of materials to facilitate a more rapid chemical reaction with fewer impurities considering the more than 50\% of reduction in the apparent activation energy under microwave irradiation.},

This critical review article provides an overview of the progress made in the development and understanding of microwave-absorbing materials. The interaction between electromagnetic radiation and absorbing materials is explained, with a focus on phenomena such as multiple reflections, scattering, and polarizations. Additionally, types of losses that affect the performance of microwave absorbers are also discussed, including dielectric loss, conduction loss, relaxation loss, magnetic loss, and morphological loss. Each of these losses has different implications for the effectiveness of microwave absorbers. Further, a detailed review is presented on various types of microwave absorbing materials, including carbonaceous materials, conducting polymers, magnetic materials, metals and their composites, 2D materials (such as MXenes and 2D-transition metal dichalcogenides), biomass-derived materials, carbides, sulphides, phosphides, high entropy (HE) materials and metamaterials. The characteristics, advantages, and limitations of each material are examined. Overall, this review article highlights the progress achieved in the field of microwave-absorbing materials. It underlines the importance of optimizing different types of losses to enhance the performance of microwave absorbers.

	abstract = {Microwave heating is a promising technique in assisting the breakage of hard and abrasive rocks. It features rapid heating and selective heating, enabling generation of large enough thermal stresses to induce damage in rocks. This paper investigated the effect of microwave treatment on the heating rate, spatial temperature distribution, ultrasonic wave velocity, elastic modulus and load bearing capacity of three igneous rocks (i.e., gabbro, monzonite and granite). The crack pattern and crack density were also studied using petrographic thin-section observations. Experimental results indicate that the single-mode microwave system can effectively and efficiently weaken the three rocks by generating cracks or melting/shattering the specimens. The heating rates and thermal gradients increase as either exposure time or power level increases. When heated at 2 kW for 120 s, the P-wave velocities of gabbro and monzonite can be reduced to 44\% and 51\%, respectively, S-wave velocities reduced to 34\% and 62\%, Young’s modulus reduced to 13\% and 27\%, load bearing capacity reduced to 34\% and 43\%. In contrast, granite specimens were more prone to violent failures at high power levels. Petrographic observations imply that the dominant crack types in gabbro, monzonite and granite are intergranular \& transgranular cracks, intergranular cracks, and transgranular cracks, respectively.},

	abstract = {Microwave induced cracks have the potential to enhance metal recovery from coarse sphalerite particles in heap leaching operations by creating new crack surface areas for lixiviant. The characteristics and quantity of microwave induced cracks and how these cracks subsequently affect heap leaching recovery has not yet been investigated. This study characterised and quantified microwave induced crack damage by applying X-ray computed tomography (XCT) and Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by Scanning Electron Microscopy (QEMSCAN) analysis. Sphalerite ore particles representing small (−5+4.75)mm, medium (−16+9.5)mm, and large (−25+19)mm HPGR and cone crushed products were microwave treated at specific microwave heating energies of between 1 and 3kWh/t. Image segmentation, thresholding and spatial registration techniques were used to study crack patterns in the XCT 3D images. The results showed the presence of microwave induced cracks within the cone and HPGR microwave treated particles. The cracks consist of both interphase trans-granular and grain boundary cracks. Both XCT and QEMSCAN analysis results showed that microwave treatment resulted in a significant increase of over 500\% in crack volume for both modes of prior comminution at all particle sizes.},

As the aim of microwave treatment of ores is liberation of the absorbing grains from the matrix rather than bulk damage to the particle, damage was quantified by comparing the tensile stress in the zones surrounding the absorbing grains with the tensile strength of the matrix. Through comparison of two different ores it was shown that the most energy-efficient method of maximising grain boundary damage is by increasing the microwave power density and decreasing the treatment time. The amount of damage incurred at a specific power density and energy input was dependent on the ore mineralogy and its texture. More grain boundary damage was induced in coarser textured ores for the same energy input and damage was maximised for ores with microwave-absorbing grains with a large thermal expansion coefficient.},

However, due to difficulties in measuring stress formation inside a solid being exposed to microwave energy, the accuracy of a suggested thermal stress weakening mechanism has not been quantified. It is thought that microwave induced differential thermal expansion of certain mineral phases is sufficient to cause stresses that exceed the strength of the material. This study simulated this proposed weakening mechanism using a quasi-static thermo-mechanical 2D model of a simplified pyrite/calcite system formulated in commercial finite difference numerical modelling software. The effects of microwave power density and exposure time on simulated uniaxial compressive strength are quantified. Power densities expected in both continuous wave and pulsed microwave applications are examined, and the work concludes that pulsed treatment is more effective for weakening rocks.

In this paper, numerical simulation using a bonded-particle model was undertaken to provide a better understanding of the mechanism of microwave-induced micro-fracture and to predict the effect of microwave power delivery and ore texture on microwave treatment of ores. Computational simulations of microwave heating and thermal damage have been carried out on two-phase conceptual ores. It was shown that the extent of damage and the crack pattern in an ore sample for the same microwave energy input depend strongly on the applied power density and the microwave absorbent phase grain size. It is possible both to reduce the energy input and to localize the microwave-induced damage around the grain boundaries by operating at high power density.

The temperature in the sample increases rapidly in 1 minute and nonuniform temperature distribution inside the object is observed. An obvious temperature hot spot is formed in the corner of the predicted temperature profile initially, which shifts to the center of the object as heating power increases. Microwave heating at 915 MHz exhibits better heating uniformity than 2450 MHz mainly because of the larger microwave penetration depth. It is also observed that the heating homogeneity in the object can be improved by reducing the dimension of object. The effects of heating time, microwave power, microwave frequency, and object dimension need to be considered to obtain high heating performance and avoid/minimize thermal runaway resulting from temperature nonuniformity in large-scale microwave heating.},

A two-dimensional circular plate, containing two-phase minerals, was used in finite element simulation to calculate thermal stress for the purpose of better understanding thermal fracture behaviour in comminution. It is found that the thermal mismatch between a microwave-absorbing inclusion and a low-absorbing matrix mineral can generate large localized thermal stresses around the inclusion. Fracture initially occurs, not around the grain boundaries between the two minerals, but some distance away, as a result of thermal expansion stress on the matrix mineral. The results also indicate that though grain size is one of the factors causing cracks during heating of granular materials, it is not the only reason. The size and the thermal properties of the matrix mineral can also affect the results of thermal stresses.},

For a realistic rock model a two-component 3D microstructure is generated by a Voronoi tessellation algorithm. The two components are microwave absorbing (phase A) and transparent (phase T), respectively. In order to calculate the electric field inside the inhomogeneous rock, a 3D finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation is performed. The absorbed heat is computed and applied as temperature distribution in a subsequent thermo-mechanical finite element (FE) analysis in order to calculate the thermally induced stresses. Two irradiation times (15s and 25s) and a microwave power of 25kW at 2.45GHz as well as three different morphologies are analyzed. Moreover, the phase transformation of quartz at 573°C is considered in the FE model. The influence of the anisotropic nature of the quartz grains is assessed by comparing the stress formation in the isotropic with those of the anisotropic case. A comparative analysis with a homogeneous model is performed in order to draw conclusions on the influence of the microstructure on the microwave induced stress formation. High maximum principal stresses on the boundaries of the microwave absorbing phase (phase A) exceeding the tensile strength are observed in the 15s irradiation model. After 25s of microwave irradiation even higher stresses as a consequence of phase transformation of quartz are determined. In the anisotropic case significantly more areas with high maximum principal stresses especially in phase T are observed. Microwave irradiation experiments on granite samples are performed in order to correlate the numerical results with experiments.},

Although the effects of microwave heating on the petrophysical characteristics of coal have been comprehensively investigated, few studies considered the complex coal-gas interactions under non-isothermal conditions. In this study, a fully coupled electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical model was developed to investigate the influence of coal compaction, thermal expansion, thermal-induced gas desorption, and sorption-induced coal deformation on CBM extraction. The results indicated that the sorption-induced coal deformation makes the predominant contribution to the porosity evolution. In addition, microwave heating can enhance the cumulative gas production by 43.9\% by promoting gas desorption and seepage. The sensitivity analysis showed that the microwave operating at 2450 MHz under lower powers is preferred to maintain efficient stimulation and to avoid overheating. Furthermore, the stimulation efficiency of microwave heating increases with the initial permeability and gas pressure. Outcomes of this study can provide valuable insights into microwave-assisted CBM recovery.},

One of the mechanisms on improving coal permeability using microwave irradiation is that thermal stress caused by microwave heating generates fractures. To study the influence of microwave settings to the heating effect of coal samples, a coupled mathematical model for electromagnetic, heat and mass transfer in the process of microwave heating is proposed and is numerically implemented using a finite element method. This coupled model for microwave heating have considered heat and mass transfer, and is validated by comparison with experimental results. Then it is used to simulate the influence of frequency, power and moisture capacity on microwave heating. The simulation results show that microwave heating of coal is highly sensitive to excitation frequency. Frequencies around 3.45 GHz contribute to significant thermal heterogeneity. With the same energy input, different powers do not influence the overall heating effect, but higher powers cause greater thermal heterogeneity. Moisture capacity also has great effect on microwave heating and thermal distribution pattern. Under 2.45 GHz and 1.0 kW, the coal sample with moisture capacity of 5\% has the best microwave heating effect.},

Thermally-induced compressive and tensile stresses increase as the microwave irradiation duration increases. The dielectric constant, coefficient of expansion, and type and size of mineralogical boundary have significant impacts on the responses of the rock to microwave irradiation. The maximum principal stress of the chlorite is the smallest, indicating that the chlorite experiences the most damage under microwave irradiation, followed by the quartz. The maximum principal stress values of plagioclase and orthoclase are larger, indicating that they are likely to incur the least damage. Where quartz or chlorite is dominant, the resulting von Mises stresses are consistently higher after 120 s of microwave irradiation. The rate of generation of von Mises stresses increases most rapidly along the interface between quartz and plagioclase, and the interface between quartz and orthoclase, followed by the interface between quartz and chlorite, and finally the interface between plagioclase and orthoclase. The presented modeling approach provides a practical method to investigate stress-strain relationships within mineralogical boundaries inside a rock thin section.},

	abstract = {As a clean energy resource, coalbed methane (CBM) has drawn worldwide attention. However, the CBM reservoir has strong adsorption capacity and low permeability and thus requires stimulation. Realized by the conversion of the electromagnetic energy into the thermal energy, microwave heating may be a sound stimulation method. In this study, the effect of microwave heating on the petrophysical characteristics of coal was investigated by combining modelling, experiment and analysis. The numerical model coupled the electromagnetic and heat transfer physics by the thermal-dependent coal permittivity. The results indicate that the increase in the microwave power contributes not only to rapid heating but also to thermal heterogeneity. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) tests show that microwave heating can induce the enlargement, opening and interconnection of pores and fractures in coal. Furthermore, the NMR multifractal theory was proposed for quantitative pore structure characterization. The calculated adsorption fractal dimension increases with the temperature, while the seepage fractal dimension shows a positive linear correlation with the thermal heterogeneity. Outcomes of this study provide valuable insight into microwave-assisted CBM recovery.},

One of the mechanisms of improving coal permeability with microwave irradiation is that thermal expansion caused by microwave heating. To study the influence of microwave’s heating effect of coal samples, the simulations were conducted using a coupled electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical model in this paper. The temperature, Von-Mises stress and strain distribution of coal sample are recorded every 10 s. The permeability distribution is also obtained based on the relationship between strain and permeability from articles. It was found that volume average temperature, stress, strain and permeability increase almost linearly with time. The average permeability increased from 1.65 × 10−16 m2 to 3.63 × 10−16 m2 under 2.45 GHz and 500 W microwave radiation after 300 s.

	abstract = {A safe, efficient and economical method of rock fragmentation is important and basic stud in mining and tunnelling. It is considered that microwave as a promising technology for rock breakage in mining and tunnelling since some hard rocks (granite, basalt etc.) show good microwave absorption under the irradiation. A 3D numerical model on a meso-scale was proposed in this paper to simulate the damage and fracturing of basalt induced by different power level (up to 3 kW) and irradiation times (1 to 60 seconds). It is a simplified model of a microwave applicator consisted of a multimode resonator and a waveguide with the specimen just below it. Importantly, the model took the inhomogeneity of materials and temperature dependence of thermal conductivity into account was closer to actual condition. Then we verified the rationality of the model. Numerical tests were performed to investigate the effect of microwave irradiation on temperature distribution and strength degradation in several groups of microwave power and exposure time. Uneven distribution of electric field and temperature were showed that they had positive correlation in the numerical simulations. The maximum temperature usually occurs inside the specimen instead of the surface and increases over time. Based on the damage criterion, we studied the form of macroscopic cracks induced by microwave and the results showed tensile failure. In addition, we contend that the specimen is weakening as long as it appears damaged area. The degree of weakening varied with external factors such as microwave irradiation power and internal factors such as tensile strength. Moreover, the macro cracks in specimen at relatively low temperature is mainly due to thermal damage of the extremely uneven temperature distribution caused by microwave irradiation in short time. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experiments results under same power level and irradiation time.},

	abstract = {The development of a model to describe the Electromagnetic-Thermal-Mechanical (ETM) multiphysics interaction in rocks requires careful consideration of the heating mechanism when microwave irradiation is applied. Since the rock breakage process by microwave energy depends on different microwave operating parameters, such as power level, exposure time, and distance from microwave antenna, a fully coupled numerical modeling approach is necessary to evaluate the corresponding effects, i.e. temperature changes, initiation of mechanical stresses, formation of micro/macro cracks, and disintegration/separation mechanism caused by thermal strains among rock particles from the coupling of ETM multiphysics interaction. To gain a better understanding of the rock breakage system due to microwave irradiation, this paper develops and analyzes numerical simulations of rock-microwave interactions using the finite element method. Several numerical models are conducted, and their results are tested and compared with data obtained from the experiments on basalt samples as part of the validation process. The models and experiments consider different microwave parameters, such as distance from microwave antenna, power level, and exposure time. The models are solved for electrical and magnetic fields, temperature distribution and maximum principal stress. The numerical results suggest that microwave energy has potential application for rock breakage and, therefore, continuous excavation.},

The complex permittivity, that is, both the real and the imaginary or absorptive parts (∈′] and ∈″), were measured under various heating regimens. In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to characterize the transformation of goethite to hematite. The Debye relaxation formalism was applied to the processes occurring both during and after the main dehydroxylation reaction to calculate the relaxation times. The Arrhenius equation for thermally activated relaxation times was used to determine the activation energies. Both the real and the absorptive parts of the permittivity exhibited a significant peak during the main part of the goethite to hematite decomposition reaction. Above the transformation, there was another, less dramatic, thermally activated increase in the permittivity values. The increase in the permittivities during the goethite to hematite transformation was attributed to the formation of quasi-free migrating radicals, for example, hydroxyl ions, oxygen ions, or hydrogen atoms, during the dehydroxylation of goethite. The derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTGA) curve was found to be directly related to the transient values of the real and the imaginary permittivities. Higher heating rates resulted in an accelerated rate of dehydroxylation and therefore higher values of the transient permittivities. In the temperature range of 400 °C to 500 °C (i.e., just above the dehydroxylation peak), the real permittivity exhibited a varying frequency dependence, which suggested that changes were occurring in the newly formed, highly defected hematite structure, which is referred to as hydrohematite. During the reaction there were multiple relaxation processes and thus the Debye relationship could not be applied. However, at temperatures above about 500 °C, the structure stabilized, the Debye relationship was more closely followed, and the relaxation times could be determined as a function of temperature. The activation energy for the relaxation process above 500 °C was determined to be 0.47 kJ/mol.},

Rock fracture is modelled by a damage-viscoplasticity model, with separate damage variables for tension and compression types of failure. A global solution strategy is developed where first the electromagnetic problem is solved in COMSOL multiphysics software, then its solution is used as an input for the thermo-mechanical problem, which is finally solved by means of a staggered explicit solution method. Due to the preeminence of the thermal radiation, the thermal and the mechanical parts of the problem are considered as uncoupled. The model behaviour is tested in 3D finite element simulations of three-mineral numerical rock specimens, with mesostructures explicitly defined, pretreated first in a microwave oven and then subjected to uniaxial compression and tension tests. The results show that the compressive and tensile strength of rock can be considerably reduced by the microwave irradiation pretreatment.},

A coupled thermo-mechanical discontinuous model for simulating the rock cracking process induced by microwave irradiation is programmed in the framework of the DDA method combined with the Voronoi tessellation net and Cohesive Zone Model. Finally, the fracture growth process, thermal property and the influence of the shape of microwave have been discussed. The fracture types could be clearly demonstrated by the improved cohesive crack model. It is found that the initial failure is the shear failure on the boundary of sensitive minerals, followed by tensile failure at the corner of minerals when the shear strength is low. The rational use of localized and concentrated microwave irradiation would be helpful on saving save energy and time for rock breaking. However, the thermal conduction has limited influence on the rock breaking under high power microwave with short duration and the impact on rock breakage increases with irradiating duration. Generally, this study has improved the application of the simulation for microwave-assisted rock breaking, and gives us a comprehensive understanding on microwave heating treatment of rock.},

However, when using traditional seismic wave methods to monitor the migration of sequestration CO2 plumes, the characteristics of wave velocity changes tend to become insignificant beyond a certain limit. In contrast, the controllable source electromagnetic method (CSEM) remains highly sensitive to resistivity changes. By simulating different CO2 plume migration conditions, we established the relevant models and calculated the corresponding electric field response characteristic curves, allowing us to analyze the CSEM’s ability to monitor CO2 plumes. We considered potential scenarios for the migration and diffusion of offshore CO2 storage, including various burial depths, vertical extension diffusion, lateral extension diffusion, multiple combinations of lateral intervals, and electric field components. We also obtained differences in resistivity inversion imaging obtained by CSEM to evaluate its feasibility in monitoring and to analyze all the electric field (Ex, Ey, and Ez) response characteristics. CSEM has great potential in monitoring CO2 plume migration in offshore saltwater reservoirs due to its high sensitivity and accuracy. Furthermore, changes in electromagnetic field response reflect the transport status of CO2 plumes, providing an important basis for monitoring and evaluating CO2 transport behavior during storage processes.},

	abstract = {The Controlled-Source ElectroMagnetic (CSEM) method provides crucial information about reservoir fluids and their spatial distribution. Carbon dioxide (CO2) storage, enhanced oil recovery (EOR), geothermal exploration, and lithium exploration are ideal applications for the CSEM method. The versatility of CSEM permits its customization to specific reservoir objectives by selecting the appropriate components of a multi-component system. To effectively tailor the CSEM approach, it is essential to determine whether the primary target reservoir is resistive or conductive. This task is relatively straightforward in CO2 monitoring, where the injected fluid is resistive. However, for scenarios involving brine-saturated (water-wet) or oil-wet (carbon capture, utilization, and storage—CCUS) reservoirs, consideration must also be given to conductive reservoir components. The optimization of data acquisition before the survey involves analyzing target parameters and the sensitivity of multi-component CSEM. This optimization process typically includes on-site noise measurements and 3D anisotropic modeling. Based on our experience, subsequent surveys tend to proceed smoothly, yielding robust measurements that align with scientific objectives. Other critical aspects to be considered are using magnetotelluric (MT) measurements to define the overall background resistivities and integrating real-time quality assurance during data acquisition with 3D modeling. This integration allows the fine tuning of acquisition parameters such as acquisition time and necessary repeats. As a result, data can be examined in real-time to assess subsurface information content while the acquisition is ongoing. Consequently, high-quality data sets are usually obtained for subsequent processing and initial interpretation with minimal user intervention. The implementation of sensitivity analysis during the inversion process plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the acquired data accurately respond to the target reservoirs’ expected depth range. To elucidate these concepts, we present an illustrative example from a CO2 storage site in North Dakota, USA, wherein the long-offset transient electromagnetic method (LOTEM), a variation of the CSEM method, and the MT method were utilized. This example showcases how surface measurements attain appropriately upscaled log-scale sensitivity. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the CSEM and MT methods was examined in other case histories, where the target reservoirs exhibited conductive properties, such as those encountered in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), geothermal, and lithium exploration applications. The same equipment specifications were utilized for CSEM and MT surveys across all case studies.},

	abstract = {Geological CO2 storage can be employed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline aquifers, and coal beds are considered to be viable subsurface CO2 storage options. Remote monitoring is essential for observing CO2 plume migration and potential leak detection during and after injection. Leak detection is probably the main risk, though overall monitoring for the plume boundaries and verification of stored volumes are also necessary. There are many effective remote CO2 monitoring techniques with various benefits and limitations. We suggest a new approach using a combination of repeated seismic and electromagnetic surveys to delineate CO2 plume and estimate the gas saturation in a saline reservoir during the lifetime of a storage site. This study deals with the CO2 plume delineation and saturation estimation using a combination of seismic and electromagnetic or controlled-source electromagnetic (EM/CSEM) synthetic data. We assumed two scenarios over a period of 40 years; Case 1 was modeled assuming both seismic and EM repeated surveys were acquired, whereas, in Case 2, repeated EM surveys were taken with only before injection (baseline) 3D seismic data available. Our results show that monitoring the CO2 plume in terms of extent and saturation is possible both by (i) using a repeated seismic and electromagnetic, and (ii) using a baseline seismic in combination with repeated electromagnetic data. Due to the nature of the seismic and EM techniques, spatial coverage from the reservoir's base to the surface makes it possible to detect the CO2 plume’s lateral and vertical migration. However, the CSEM low resolution and depth uncertainties are some limitations that need consideration. These results also have implications for monitoring oil production—especially with water flooding, hydrocarbon exploration, and freshwater aquifer identification.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide storage in deep saline aquifers can potentially reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities with limited environmental impact. To minimize the risks of leakage, it is necessary to monitor the CO2 distribution in the reservoir. Here, we present a stochastic optimization method namely the Ensemble Smoother, to invert time-lapse marine controlled source electromagnetic data for predicting the CO2 plume location. Electromagnetic surveys have been successfully used in subsurface monitoring studies in different geosciences applications due to their sensitivity to the changes in the fluid in porous rocks. The inverse method is based on a Bayesian approach, in which an ensemble of stochastically generated prior models representing the spatial distribution of CO2 saturation is updated according to the mismatch between the measured data and the predicted electromagnetic response of the prior models. The proposed method generates an ensemble of updated realizations, the posterior models of the spatial distribution of CO2 saturation, that match the observations. The variance of the posterior models represents the uncertainty of the CO2 distribution. Compared to deterministic inversion methods, our proposed method is better suited to solve non-linear inverse problems with the added benefit of uncertainty quantification. The method is tested and validated on a real dataset, the Johansen formation, offshore Norway, for which we created synthetic time-lapse electromagnetic data for the entire injection period. The inversion of electromagnetic data shows that the proposed method can accurately predict the prediction of the CO2 plume location and quantify the associated uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Carbon capture and storage via the injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) into deep saline aquifers, also known as geological storage of CO2, has been used to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, geologically sequestered CO2 can seep out through leaky wells and faults, thereby contaminating groundwater and reaching the atmosphere. Several facilities for controlled injection of CO2 into the shallow subsurface have been constructed to enhance understanding of the impacts of CO2 on the physical properties of the subsurface and to improve the early detection of CO2 leakage, before it reaches the atmosphere. Among various monitoring methods, geophysical methods have been employed widely to detect CO2 plume migration at shallow depths before CO2 enters the atmosphere. In this study, geophysical monitoring during CO2 injection at eight field sites and in five laboratory experiments was reviewed and analyzed. The analysis encompassed not only changes in subsurface geophysical properties, such as bulk electrical resistivity, complex resistivity, induced-polarization parameters, and electrical permittivity related to the presence of CO2, but also the effects of geological conditions on changes in these geophysical properties. Case studies of geophysical monitoring for natural CO2 leakage from gas vents are also discussed to provide real examples of CO2 degassing and leakage into the atmosphere. Geophysical surveys are sufficiently effective and sensitive for the monitoring of changes in geophysical properties due to the presence of CO2 leaked from sequestration reservoirs, and will be much more effective after the identification of high-risk regions for CO2 leakage from the Earth’s surface.},

	abstract = {For geologic carbon storage, the ability to detect secondary CO2 plumes—defined as those CO2 plumes accumulating outside the intended storage reservoir—is fundamental to preventing unexpected CO2 migration into groundwater resources and for risk and liability management. Understanding the sensitivity of various geophysical methods to secondary plumes is crucial for designing cost-effective monitoring schemes. We use several modeling scenarios to demonstrate the process of assessing sensitivities and detection thresholds of three primary geophysical techniques—surface seismic, borehole-to-surface electromagnetic (EM), and surface and borehole gravity—for early detection of secondary CO2 plumes in the post-injection phase. While seismic reflection methods are often considered in monitoring strategies to track the evolution of CO2 plumes, they are also the most expensive. Due to cost considerations, especially for long-term post-injection monitoring, other techniques complement seismic monitoring when designing an adaptive monitoring network. Borehole-to-surface EM or surface gravity surveys are feasible for time-lapse monitoring of deep secondary CO2 plumes. These surveys could be carried at intervals defined by site-specific conditions. If time-lapse EM and/or gravity surveys detect any signal responses beyond the expected change, it would trigger a need for the higher resolution seismic survey.},

The assessment is based on multiple reservoir simulations and uncertainty quantification of the CO2 plume characteristics as well as for the most relevant data variables. We consider multiple time decision-making processes, which require probability updating after collecting data at previous time steps. To demonstrate the suggested workflow, we perform dynamic simulations of the CO2 saturation fluid flow model based on a simplified version of the Smeaheia reservoir characterization model. The results show that the value of information depends on the acquisition time and on the previously measured geophysical data.

Recently, the utilization of the marine CSEM method has shifted from petroleum exploration to active monitoring due to increased environmental concerns related to hydrocarbon production. In this study, we utilize the various dynamic reservoir properties available through reservoir simulation of the Wisting field in the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea. In detail, we first developed geologically consistent rock physics models corresponding to reservoirs at different production phases, and then transformed them into resistivity models. The constructed resistivity models pertaining to different production phases can be used as input models for a finite difference time domain (FDTD) forward modeling workflow to simulate EM responses. This synthetic CSEM data can be studied and analyzed in the light of production-induced changes in the reservoir at different production phases. Our results demonstrate the ability of CSEM data to detect and capture production-induced changes in the fluid content of a producing hydrocarbon reservoir. The anomalous CSEM responses correlating to the reservoir resistivity change increase with the advance of the production phase, and a similar result is shown in anomalous transverse resistance (ATR) maps derived from the constructed resistivity models. Moreover, the responses at 30 Hz with a 3000 m offset resulted in the most pronounced anomalies at the Wisting reservoir. Hence, the method can effectively be used for production-monitoring purposes.},

Consequently, it is possible to reliably estimate SoPhiH maps from CSEM time-lapse surveys using such a relationship. We demonstrate our workflow’s effectiveness in the mature Marlim oilfield by simulating the CSEM time-lapse response after 30 and 40 years of seawater injection and detecting the remaining sweet spots in the reservoir. The Marlim reservoirs are analogous to several turbidite reservoirs worldwide, which can also be appraised with the proposed workflow. The prediction of SoPhiH maps by using CSEM data inversion can significantly improve reservoir time-lapse characterization.},

Until recently, the seismic method was the dominant technique used for reservoir monitoring. In this paper we present a feasibility study of permanent electromagnetic (EM) monitoring of CO2 sequestration in a deep reservoir using a novel borehole-to-surface EM (BSEM) method. The advantage of this method is that the sources of the EM field are located within the borehole close to the target reservoir, which increases the sensitivity and resolution of the method. Another innovation is the use of capacitive electric field sensors with an operational lifetime of tens of years. We illustrate the effectiveness of the BSEM method by computer simulating CO2 injection monitoring in the Kevin Dome sequestration site in Montana, USA.},

This first involved acquiring both electric and magnetic fields at eleven different locations ranging in distance from immediately adjacent to 4 km from the plant. Passive EM measurements were made to provide spectral EM noise measurements generated by electricity production at the plant and to determine if useful magnetotelluric (MT) data can be successfully collected in the region. The processed data indicate that useful MT data can be collected as long as the site is located more than 2km away from the power plant as well as active roads and rail lines. Controlled source EM data were collected using three different source configurations, two of which connected to steel casings used to complete the injection wells. Comparing the EM noise measurements to the CSEM data show measurable electric and magnetic field signals at all sites. Next a series of three-dimensional (3D) numerical models were built that simulate resistivity changes caused by the proposed CO2 injection at depths ranging from 2.4 to 3.0km. These models were used to simulate various EM measurement configurations. The modeling shows that casing-source CSEM monitoring can provide sensitivity to the injected CO2 if source electrodes are connected to the bottom of one or both of the injection wells.},

Electrical and electromagnetic methods (EM) are complementary to seismic and gravity methods for their sensitivity to changes in fluid properties. Electrical and EM techniques are used to map the electrical resistivity of the subsurface. This resistivity can be used to determine porosity and estimate the formation pore fluids composition and saturation. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) injection into relatively flat lying formations results in lenticular lenses or plumes of finite size. Under supercritical conditions, typically at depths greater than 800 m, CO 2 has the properties of a gas, but behaves as a liquid; therefore CO 2 takes a much smaller volume than if it would be in a gas phase. The replacement of highly conductive (low resistivity) saline fluids with resistive CO 2 results in a resistivity increase in the formation. The detection of resistive targets is more challenging because they produce much smaller signals than conductive targets. The choice of the technique and the configuration will depend on the CO 2 plume volume and its depth. We present detectability analyses using a thin resistive layer and sphere models for a range of electrical and EM techniques for mapping the injection of resistive liquid CO 2 into reservoir-like formations at depth.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new adaptive multi-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approach for simulating three-dimensional free surface flows with fluid impacting. The governing equations for multi-resolution SPH are derived based on the finite particle method (FPM) particle interpolation, which is an alternative SPH formulation for improving interpolation accuracy in the non-uniform particle distribution. A variable kernel length related to the volume of neighbor particles is proposed to control the numerical instability due to the multi-resolution scheme. In adaptive particle refinement (APR), a concept named as continuously-variable characteristic length (CCL) for each particle is defined to determine the splitting or merging scheme and then build a smoothing non-uniform particle distribution. Three-dimensional examples are conducted to validate the presented new APR approach, and the capability and numerical efficiency of the proposed numerical model are verified through solving free-surface flow problems with middle and low Weber numbers. After validation, a refined simulation of droplet impacting is conducted using the proposed adaptive multi-resolution SPH approach. The results show that the proposed SPH could well adapt to the large deformation of three-dimensional free-surface flow, and only provide a refinement near the free-surface domain.},

The efficiency lies in reducing the computational effort via spatial adaptivity, for which a dynamic particle refinement pattern with an optimized neighbor-search algorithm is used. The melt pool dynamics is modeled by resolving the thermal, mechanical, and material fields in a single laser track application. After validating the solver by two benchmark tests where analytical and experimental data are available, we simulate a single-track LPBF process by adopting SPH in multi resolutions. The LPBF simulation results show that the proposed adaptive refinement with and without an optimized neighbor-search approach saves almost 50\% and 35\% of the SPH calculation time, respectively. This achievement enables several opportunities for parametric studies and running high-resolution models with less computational effort.},

This paper, within the framework of a fully 3D and multi-resolution Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model, aims at investigating the water entry dynamics of a free-fall lifeboat with different water entry angles. First of all, two rigorous model validations are performed to demonstrate the accuracy, stability and convergence of the present SPH model. Furthermore, the water entry dynamics of the lifeboat with respect to different water entry angles, including the motion characteristics and cavity evolutions, is investigated and discussed in detail based on the SPH results. It is clearly demonstrated that the present SPH model possesses (1) satisfactory accuracy for predicting the water entry dynamics of a lifeboat, and (2) a better ability to capture the splashing jets and scattering droplets than mesh-based solvers thanks to its entirely Lagrangian nature. In addition, it is also demonstrated that the water entry angle exerts significant effects on the water entry dynamics of a lifeboat, which should be taken into account in the design stage to provide safer productions.},

The FSI solver includes a consistent fluid-structure coupling scheme along with a novel multi-resolution scheme incorporating a common influence length, a modified SPH density definition and a SPH-based formulated SPP (Space Potential Particle) scheme in order to achieve consistent particle-based discretizations, precise satisfaction of fluid-structure interface boundary conditions and accurate volume conservation at the interface. The present ISPH fluid model corresponds to a refined version of ISPH incorporating several previously developed refined schemes, and hence the proposed FSI solver is referred to as “Enhanced Multi-resolution ISPH-SPH”. Validations are performed qualitatively/quantitatively through reproductions of classical as well as ocean engineering benchmark tests. Comparisons are also made with an MPS-based FSI solver as well as an Explicit ISPH-based one. A preliminary extension of the proposed solver to three-dimensions is also presented.},

	abstract = {Concerns about future supplies of raw materials demand careful examination of underlying assumptions and data. Flawed deposit information, ignored undiscovered resources and questionable assumptions about future consumption require a new look at copper resources. A careful compilation of 1978 copper-bearing mineral deposits totals 2700 million metric tons of copper including past production—considerably more than reported in previous studies. About 69\% of the copper is in porphyry copper deposits and 12\% in sediment-hosted copper, Magmatic sulfide (mostly intrusive Ni) deposits account for 5.1\%, and IOGC adds about 4.7\%. VMS deposits represent 45\% of the 1978 deposits but only 4.9\% of the copper. The largest 20\% of the deposits account for over 92\% of the total copper metal. In other words, total Cu content in the smaller 1600 deposits is only about 8\% of all Cu known in all deposits. This is a consequence of highly skewed frequency distributions of deposit tonnages and contained metals in all kinds of mineral deposits. This relationship is critical if one is concerned about long-term supply of copper. Typically, distributions of contained metal can be modeled well by the lognormal distribution for individual types of deposits. Information used here and in many other studies on copper includes past production. Total past production through 2015 is about 667 million tons Cu. After subtracting past production from the total copper in known deposits, the remaining unproduced copper from known deposits is 2030 million tons. Known deposits inform us about undiscovered copper resources. Over 80\% of known copper is in porphyry copper and sediment-hosted copper deposits. A reliable and robust USGS managed global assessment of 225 tracts for porphyry Cu and sediment-hosted Cu produced an expected value estimate of 3500 million tons Cu in undiscovered deposits. Deposit types not assessed such as IOGC are likely to have significant amounts of undiscovered copper. If the proportion of total Cu accounted for by the two major deposit types assessed is the same proportion in all undiscovered deposits, total Cu expected in these other deposit types would add an additional 850 million tons. The reasonable estimate of copper in undiscovered mineral deposits of 4350 million tons when added to the unmined 2030 million tons in known deposits provides an estimate of 6380 million of tons Cu, which far exceeds estimates published by other researchers. Growth in copper production appears to be exponential over time but appears to be linear with respect to population. Demand for copper is not driven by time, but rather by population and per capita income. Rates of population increases are slowing and incomes in many countries are increasing. Per capita consumption of copper will increase over the coming years as populous nations such as China and India develop increasing per capita incomes, but the demand will likely level off as their economies improve. The large estimated copper resources along with evidence of slowing demand for copper over the long term considerably extend the time of “peak copper” and the long mine life of large deposits means the decline in production after will not be rapid. The focus of copper supply concerns should be on important problems such as improving recovery rates, careful consideration of the benefits and costs of mining very large deposits, technologies to increase exploration success in covered areas and reducing costs of underground mining.},

It has been established that the impact of mining and mineral processing operations must be reduced to sustainably meet the demands of a low grade future. Successful incorporation of ore sorting in flow sheets has the potential to improve energy efficiency by rejecting non-economic material before grinding. Microwave heating combined with infra-red temperature measurement has been shown to distinguish low and high grade ore fragments from each other. In this work, experimentally validated 2-D finite difference models of a theoretical two phase ore, representing typical fragment textures and grades, are constructed. Microwave heating is applied at economically viable energy inputs and the resultant surface thermal profiles analysed up to 2min after microwave heating. It is shown that the size and location of grains can dramatically alter surface temperature rise at short thermal measurement delay times and that the range of temperatures increases with increasing fragment grade. For the first time, it is suggested that increasing the delay time between microwave heating and thermal measurement can reduce the variation seen for fragments of the same grade but different textures, improving overall differentiation between high and low grade fragments.},

The algorithm has been implemented into the DualSPHysics open-source code and it has been tested and validated through a series of different study cases. The capability of the numerical scheme to simulate multiscale fluid flow has been demonstrated by solving the flow past a cylinder for a Reynolds number of 9,500 and a ratio between the largest and smallest particle size equal to 28. Furthermore, the proposed SPH multi-resolution algorithm can also be used for flow around moving objects, such as an oscillating cylinder in cross-flow, and free-surface flow, such as the simulation of a triangular wedge impacting on the free surface of a quiescent liquid.},

	abstract = {In laminated, anisotropic unconventional rocks (ultra-tight shale, tight gas, coal seam, and so forth), the true hydraulic-fracturing mode is a complex, mixed-mode process. The fracture-modeling practitioner often encounters a wide range of fracture models. The selection of an appropriate fracture model has become a daunting task with significant implications for the hydraulic-fracturing pre-treatment design or post-treatment diagnostic evaluation. Therefore, it is crucial to properly identify the assumptions and limitations of each model, and how they affect the modeling output as well as the treatment design. This study provides a critical review of the assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages of the more-common fracture models in hydraulic-fracturing simulation. The models covered range from the simplified 2D, pseudo 3D (P3D), and lumped parameter (LP) models to 3D planar-fracture models (elastically coupled and shear-decoupled models), and to more complex 3D models including the displacement discontinuity model (DDM), discrete fracture network (DFN) model, distinct element model (DEM), bonded particle model (BPM), synthetic rock mass (SRM) using BPM and smooth joint model (SJM), lattice model (including the dual-lattice implementation of SRM), continuum and extended-continuum models, and the meshless models. The advantages and disadvantages of the more advanced 3D models are analyzed in the context of simulating special cases, including alternate fracturing and hydraulic fracturing in naturally fractured reservoirs. In the context of these special cases, the capabilities and limitations of these models in incorporating the complex interactions between the hydraulic fractures, and between hydraulic and pre-existing fractures and joints are discussed. This study outlines how a fracture model should be carefully selected, considering the geological and geomechanical conditions, availability of data, and the scope of investigation.},

	abstract = {Unconventional reservoirs such as shale and coal rock are generally well-bedded, with significant differences in the interlayer stress and rock physical parameters. The change law of the fracture morphology is difficult to predict after the layer-through propagation of the fracture height during the fracturing operation. Existing studies have widely used multilayered two-dimensional fracture height models, which are not suitable for fracture propagation simulation in unconventional reservoirs under complex geological conditions. This study established a fracture height propagation model based on the three-dimensional (3D) discrete lattice method and used the Xsite software to simulate the layer-through propagation in layered strata under the influence of in-situ stress, rock physical properties, and construction parameters. The effects of different factors on the fracture height and fracture morphology are described. Sensitivity analysis for different model cases revealed that, when the fractures entered a formation with high in-situ stress and fracture toughness, the growth of the fracture height was restrained. As the elastic modulus of the rock increased, the fracture width significantly decreased and the fracture height increased. Increasing the fracturing fluid displacement benefits the growth of the fracture height and width, and accelerates the passage of hydraulic fracture through the interlayer interface to achieve deep penetration reconstruction in the longitudinal direction of the reservoir. Higher fracturing fluid viscosity increases the fracture width and reduces the fracture reconstruction volume, and the fracture morphology changes under different fracturing fluid viscosity. This study is useful for improving and supplementing unconventional reservoir fracture height simulation technology.},

Particle-based models provide advantages over other models and solutions for the simulation of fracturing of rock masses that cannot be assumed to be continuous and homogeneous. It has been demonstrated (Potyondy and Cundall Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 41:1329–1364, 2004) that particle models based on a simple force criterion for fracture propagation match theoretical solutions and scale effects derived using the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The challenge is how to apply these models effectively (i.e., with acceptable models sizes and computer run times) to the coupled hydro-mechanical problems of relevant time and length scales for practical field applications (i.e., reservoir scale and hours of injection time). A formulation of a fully coupled hydro-mechanical particle-based model and its application to the simulation of hydraulic treatment of unconventional reservoirs are presented. Model validation by comparing with available analytical asymptotic solutions (penny-shape crack) and some examples of field application (e.g., interaction with DFN) are also included.},

	abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing is the prime technology for enhancing production from unconventional reservoirs. Design and operation of hydraulic fracturing requires adequate knowledge of formation properties, in situ stresses and fluid properties, due to its complex nature. One of the challenges, that have been the subject of many past studies, is the interaction mechanism when hydraulic fracture intersects a natural interface (e.g., natural fracture or interbed). Crossing, arresting and opening are the known interaction mechanisms. The formation properties, state of in situ stresses, stress contrast, strength properties of the interface, angle of intersection and injecting fluid characteristics affect the interaction mechanism to different extents. The use of numerical models is widespread in simulation of hydraulic fracturing. The use of methods based on the continuum (e.g., FEM) and discontinum (e.g., DEM) representation of media is subjected to some limitations in predicting the correct geometry of the propagating fracture. Lattice method, which is based on the bonded particle approach, has shown promise in simulating hydraulic fracturing. In this paper, lattice modeling is used to simulate the interaction mechanism of lab experiments carried out on mortar samples but at larger scales. The cubical mortar samples of 10 cm size had two synthetically built natural fractures with different angles of approach and filled with different types of glue. The effect of intersection angle and the mechanical properties of the interface were simulated numerically under conditions of viscosity-dominated fracture propagation regime as occurred in the lab. The results demonstrate the advantages of lattice simulation to study the impact of each parameter on the fracture interaction. A larger angle of approach and stronger glues are shown to promote the crossing mode. The shear strength and stress anisotropy are the main parameters influencing the interaction mechanism.},

	abstract = {This work introduces 3D lattice modeling of hydraulic fracturing initiation and near-wellbore propagation for different perforation models, including spiral perforation, oriented perforation and Tristim perforation. For each perforation model, a total of six perforation tunnels are explicitly modeled and the representative intermediate states are chosen to analyze the results. The numerical simulation results show that the perforation tunnels guide the generation of initial microcracks at the roots of the perforation tunnels once the injection starts, however, the subsequent fracture propagation is controlled by the relative locations of perforation tunnels and the stress interference among different perforation tunnels. The spiral perforation gives the highest breakdown pressure while the Tristim perforation gives the lowest. Trans-wellbore fracture surfaces caused by the generation of large amount of microannulus cracks is the main reason of the pressure breakdown. The magnitude of the breakdown pressure is associated with the level of fracture complexity generated before the breakdown. Despite the vari­ ation of breakdown pressure for different perforation models, both the initial minimum pressure after the breakdown and the propagation pressure are nearly identical. The study provides a theoretical basis for un­ derstanding fracture initiation and near-wellbore tortuosity.},

	abstract = {Multiple cluster hydraulic fracturing is widely used in the development of shale reservoir. The morphology of multiple fractures propagating from multiple cluster is complex due to the stress shadow effect. The design and operation of multiple cluster hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells require adequate knowledge of the effect of different factors, including rock properties, insitu stresses and fluid properties on the fracture morphology. In this paper, lattice simulation, a new particle based computational method was used to investigate the multiple cluster hydraulic fracturing in shale. The results showed that stress anisotropy and cluster spacing play an important role on geometry of the propagating fracture. The middle hydraulic fracture is restricted to propagate when cluster spacing is decreased. Simultaneous, two-step and sequential fracturing scenarios in a single horizontal well were simulated. The simultaneous and sequential fracturing showed to mainly affect the fracture propagation morphology with little effect on fracture length, while the middle fracture is shorter than its two side fractures in two-step fracturing. In two horizontal models, the simultaneous and sequential fractures showed similar morphology during multiple cluster hydraulic fracturing. In term of stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), zipper fracturing showed the largest SRV during multiple cluster hydraulic fracturing in two horizontal wells.},

	abstract = {A hydro-mechanical coupled lattice-based model for the simulation of crack propagation induced by ﬂuid injection in porous saturated rocks containing cohesive joints is presented. Rock follows an isotropic damage model for tensile fracture and cohesive joints follow a coupled plasticitydamage model. The discretisation uses a dual lattice approach: a Delaunay triangulation for the solid and the boundaries of the associated Voronoï tesselation for the hydraulic part. A classical poromechanical framework for a materials saturated with a single ﬂuid is implemented. First, predictions of crack propagation are compared with analytical models. Then, the interaction between a propagating crack and an existing joint is analysed. Two conﬁgurations are considered: the case of a joint that is orthogonal to the crack path and the case of a joint that is inclined by 45° with respect to the crack path. For the vertical joint, the crack is ﬁrst arrested because the cohesive joint is weaker than the rock mass. The crack reinitiates at both crack tips and subsequently propagates in one of them. For the inclined joint, the crack follows the joint and therefore its path is deviated. Damage in the rock develops in the back of the crack tip, thereby enhancing the increase of permeability due to damage in the rock mass.},

	abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing unlocks previously inaccessible hydrocarbons in unconventional reservoirs by creating artificial pathways in the unconventional reservoir. Numerical simulation expands the scope of hydraulic fracturing design for various reservoir conditions. This review paper explores the synergy between numerical simulation and hydraulic fracturing modeling, focusing on critical elements like geomechanical behavior, geological conditions, and fluid dynamics. Analytical models in hydraulic fracturing design are discussed to underscore their foundational importance. The assumption of constant fracture height limits the application of Perkins–Kern–Nordgren model (PKN) and KristianovichGeertsma-de Klerk model (KGD). Radial models assume 3D flow but lack reliability in nonradial settings, and the Pseudo 3D model (P3D) shares PKN’s assumptions with variable fracture height, sacrificing some details for efficiency. Planar 3D model (PL3D) enhances accuracy by discarding PKN’s elastic response assumption but requires extended computation. Unconventional fracture model is effective for complex scenarios but relies on DFN modeling parameters for accuracy. The choice of numerical simulation method in hydraulic fracturing depends on the specific aspect studied, each with its strengths and limitations. For instance, boundary element methods are efficient for exterior problems, finite element modeling suits 3D nonplanar fractures, and the extended finite element method excels in hydraulic and natural fracture interactions. Peridynamics shows potential but needs further development for cost-effectiveness. PFC and UDEC/3DEC-based simulations can explore microscopic mechanisms. Combining these methods with other approaches provides a comprehensive study of realistic reservoir conditions. This review guides the selection of a suitable numerical simulation methodology based on the study’s scope.},

	abstract = {The brittle failure of rock material is closely related to crack propagation and coalescence. Wing crack is the most common manifestation of crack propagation subject to compression. Previous studies proved that under uniaxial compression, 2D wing cracks were able to propagate extensively and split the rock specimen. In contrast, the propagation of 3D wing cracks was somehow restricted under uniaxial compression. However, under biaxial compression, even a small intermediate principal stress could trigger extensive 3D wing propagation. It remains elusive why extensive 3D wing propagation was so sensitive to intermediate principal stress. In this study, we develop a numerical model to simulate the propagation of 3D wing cracks under compression. The morphology of 3D wing cracks is correlated with axial compressive stress, which sheds light on the triggering mechanism of extensive 3D wing propagation. According to our interpretation, the reasons that extensive 3D wing propagation is sensitive to intermediate principal stress are twofold. (1) Intermediate principal stress is very effective to suppress lateral spalling, thus the specimen failure is solely attributed to the wing propagation. (2) Upon specimen failure under uniaxial compression, 3D wing cracks are in a critical state transitioning from stable to unstable propagation, and intermediate principal stress facilitates such transition. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the extensive 3D wing propagation under compression, which reconciles all elusive experimental phenomena in previous studies.},

	abstract = {Fracture propagation under mixed-mode loading conditions prevails in many natural geological processes and deep engineering projects, while the corresponding numerical simulation is very challenging in rock mechanics, especially in 3D cases. In most previous studies, the complexity of 3D fracture geometry was over-simplified, and model III loading was often not considered. In this study, we propose to use an efficient stress-based Schöllmann criterion combined with Displacement Discontinuity Method (DDM) to model 3D fracture propagation under arbitrary I ​+ ​II ​+ ​III mixed-mode loading conditions. A novel curve-smoothing algorithm is developed to smoothen the fracture front during propagation, which significantly enhances the model's ability in dealing with complex 3D fracture geometry. In particular, we adopt two different solution schemes, namely staggered and monolithic, to simulate mode I fracture propagation in the case of hydraulic fracturing. The accuracy, efficiency and convergency of the two solution schemes are compared in detail. Our research findings suggest that the degree of coupling between fracture aperture and fluid pressure in hydraulic fracturing lies somewhere between one-way and two-way, which favors the staggered solution scheme. To further test our new model, we provide three additional numerical examples associated with 3D fracture propagation under various mixed-mode loading conditions. Our model shows excellent performance in efficiently locating the new fracture front and reliably capturing the complex 3D fracture geometry. This study provides a generic algorithm to model high-fidelity 3D fracture propagation without simplifying fracture geometry or loading conditions, making it widely applicable to fracture-propagation-related problems.},

The focus of this study is the performance evaluation of multilateral closed deep geothermal (MCDG) systems as a novel environmentally friendly approach for energy extraction from earth. The investigations on these synthetic systems assume a probabilistic number of borehole sections with several vertical and horizontal wellbores connected through some manifolds and doglegs. To reduce possible thermal losses, the circulated fluid is extracted through only one production wellbore. The findings of this study demonstrated that the heat absorption per meter of MCDG systems is much higher than for simple closed geothermal systems (CDG). Operating with these systems will not necessarily yield better performance. It is also found that the long-term performance of MCDG systems can be predicted as a function of their short-term behavior through stochastic analysis. This correlation is interestingly independent of the number of wellbores and flow rate. By defining specific criteria, the high-performance MCDG systems can be filtered to demonstrate common features as a specific relation between flow rates per vertical and horizontal wellbores. This characterization of MCDG systems should support the design of future high-performance systems.},

To guide engineering design and evaluate performance of proppant placement, a full understanding of the underlying physics and robust numerical models are needed. This paper introduces a continuum approach for simulating the transport of multiple fluids and proppant particles within hydraulic fractures. To achieve computational efficiency, this proppant model is developed based on the assumption of multi-component single phase flow and captures proppant settling, hindering effects, proppant-bed erosion and transport. Inter-particle stresses and collisions are not numerically calculated but represented through empirical correlations to include the effects of particle clustering and hindered settling. This model couples the fluid phase and particle phase through the slip velocity, which is governed by particle settling, particle–particle interaction and fluid-particle drag forces. The presented proppant model is validated by comparing numerical results with experimental data. With the calibrated simulation, the modeling capabilities on fracturing treatment design are demonstrated through sensitivity analysis and field-scale applications. Moreover, based on proppant placement and deformation, a generic model is applied to forecast fracture conductivity in different scenarios. As illustrated in this study, this coupled three-dimensional model is capable of simulating proppant placement and fracture conductivity under various operational conditions. This model can be broadly applied to improve fracturing design in various formations, including tight sandstone, shale, coal bed methane and carbonate reservoirs.},

This paper develops an integrated hydraulic fracturing simulator by coupling a planar three-dimensional (PL3D) fracture propagation model with an efficient Eulerian–Lagrangian (E–L) proppant transport model. The fracture propagation model uses the finite volume method (FVM) and displacement discontinuity method (DDM) to solve the fluid flow and rock deformation, respectively. For proppant transport, we develop a pseudo-3D multiphase particle-in-cell (P3D MP-PIC) model, in which the fluid flow is addressed by FVM as a continuum, but the particles are tracked in a Lagrangian fashion as discrete phases. In contrast to Eulerian–Eulerian (E–E) proppant transport models, the P3D MP-PIC can efficiently deal with multi-modal particle simulations (i.e., particles of different sizes or materials) and avoid the problem of numerical diffusion. The fracture propagation and proppant transport models are validated by analytical solutions and laboratory experiments. We adopt a one-way coupling strategy to consider the effect of complex fracture propagation and fluid leak-off on slurry transport, in which the dynamic fracture geometry and fluid leak-off is first computed via the fracture propagation model, followed by the fully coupled fluid–particle simulation using the P3D MP-PIC. The integrated model can simulate the fracturing treatments in multilayered reservoirs with varying confining stresses at an industrial field scale. The simulation results can improve the prediction of effective/propped fracture geometries and better the fracturing designs.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop an efficient proppant transport model using the Eulerian-Eulerian approach for simulating proppant transport in fractures and 3D fracture networks in geothermal reservoirs. The proposed model accounts for proppant settling, pack/bed formation, bridging/screenout, proppant concentration effect, fracture wall effect, and the transition from Poiseuille flow (fracture channel) to Darcy flow (proppant pack). Notably, the heat transfer process and its impact on proppant transport are also considered—a facet often overlooked in previous proppant transport models. A three-dimensional displacement discontinuity method (3D DDM) that incorporates the stress shadow effect is employed to generate the fracture geometry. The governing equations for slurry flow, proppant transport, and heat transfer are discretized and solved using the finite volume method (FVM). The model is verified against analytical solutions and published experimental data, demonstrating good agreement with these references. To demonstrate the proposed model, we applied it to both low-temperature (depleted hydrocarbon wells) and high-temperature (dry hot rocks) enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). The simulation results highlight the significant influence of reservoir temperature on proppant transport and settlement in a reservoir environment. Heating of the slurry by higher temperature reservoir rocks reduces fluid viscosity and accelerates proppant settling, thereby shortening the transport distance and reducing the coverage area of the proppant. Both ultra-light and micro-proppant are effective in mitigating proppant settlement in enhanced geothermal systems. However, proppant is susceptible to bridging at fracture intersections, where the fracture widths are narrower due to more pronounced stress shadow effects in these areas. Consequently, the use of micro-proppant could offer substantial benefits over ultra-light proppant in enhancing proppant coverage area in enhanced geothermal systems.},

	abstract = {Exploring dynamic mechanical responses and failure behaviors of hot dry rock (HDR) is significant for geothermal exploitation and stability assessment. In this study, via the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system, a series of dynamic compression tests were conducted on granite treated by cyclic thermal shocks at different temperatures. We analyzed the effects of cyclic thermal shock on the thermal-related physical and dynamic mechanical behaviors of granite. Specifically, the P-wave velocity, dynamic strength, and elastic modulus of the tested granite decrease with increasing temperature and cycle number, while porosity and peak strain increase. The degradation law of dynamic mechanical properties could be described by a cubic polynomial. Cyclic thermal shock promotes shear cracks propagation, causing dynamic failure mode of granite to transition from splitting to tensile-shear composite failure, accompanied by surface spalling and debris splashing. Moreover, the thermal shock damage evolution and coupled failure mechanism of tested granite are discussed. The evolution of thermal shock damage with thermal shock cycle numbers shows an obvious S-shaped surface, featured by an exponential correlation with dynamic mechanical parameters. In addition, with increasing thermal shock temperature and cycles, granite mineral species barely change, but the length and width of thermal cracks increase significantly. The non-uniform expansion of minerals, thermal shock-induced cracking, and water-rock interaction are primary factors for deteriorating dynamic mechanical properties of granite under cyclic thermal shock.},

For that reason, we have conducted a series of laboratory tests on air and water cooled granites from normal temperature to 600 °C, to reveal the changes in their thermomechanical properties. At 600 °C, the average values of uniaxial compressive strength, elastic modulus and P-wave velocity of water cooled granite decrease by 84.9\%, 73.1\% and 66.2\%, which are 11.0\%, 17.0\% and 17.7\% larger than those of air cooled granite. Through optical microscopic analysis, the microcrack density and average width of water cooled granite increase with thermal temperature and are 4.18 mm/mm2 and 54.62 μm at 600 °C, while the values of air cooled granite are only 1.97 mm/mm2 and 25.16 μm. We thus combined the deterioration of the macroscopic mechanical characteristics of air and water cooled granites with the propagation and development of microcracks.

In this study, to identify the physical and mechanical properties of granite observed before and after high-temperature treatment from room temperature to 1000 °C and to determine the influence of high temperatures on granite and on its intrinsic connections, appearance, and mineral morphology, longitudinal wave testing and uniaxial and triaxial tests were performed. Our primary conclusions are as follows: (1) effects of high temperatures on microscopic minerals of granite primarily include the oxidation of dark minerals, the recrystallization of feldspar minerals, and the generation and extension of mineral cracks. (2) High temperatures decrease the speed of longitudinal waves in granite and cause longitudinal wave energy to be absorbed. Cracks created by high temperatures cause longitudinal waves to not be detected. (3) Relationships between stress and strain processes at 400 °C in granite first soften and subsequently harden, and mechanical properties change only slightly overall. After a temperature of 400 °C is reached, with increasing temperatures, softening characteristics emerge. At 800 °C, plastic deformation occurs. At 1000 °C, the strength and deformability of rock specimens are largely diminished. We found 600 °C to be the threshold of mechanical properties and the transition temperature of the failure mode. (4) Finally, 400 °C, 600 °C, and 800 °C were found to be characteristic temperatures of three different stages of physical and mechanical properties for granite.},

Characterizations were made by measurement of porosity, gas permeability, velocity and attenuation of ultrasonic waves. Our study confirms the strong influence of thermal damage on physical properties, and shows clearly the potential of the above techniques in connection with this type of damage. Typically, we show that the porosity measurement only informs about open porosity, which is distributed and available at rock surface, whereas the gas permeability measurement characterizes the connected porosity. As for the ultrasonic wave propagation, it is sensitive to overall damage in the material. Nevertheless, we observed that the three techniques are complementary and similarly describe the rock behavior in each stage of heat treatment; they show a good consistency between them.},

	abstract = {The evolution of porosity and changes in wave velocity in granite after high-temperature treatment has been experimentally investigated in different studies. Statistical analysis of the test results shows that there is a temperature threshold value that leads to variations in porosity and wave velocity. At a temperature that is less than 200 °C, the porosity of granite slowly increases with increases in temperature, while the wave velocity decreases. When the temperature is greater than 200 °C (especially between 400 and 600 °C), the porosity quickly increases, while the wave velocity substantially decreases. The temperature ranges of room temperature to 200 and 200–400 °C correspond to the undamaged state and the micro-damage state, respectively. The results confirm that there is an important link between the variations of physical and mechanical properties in response to thermal treatment. By studying the relationships among rock porosity, wave velocity and temperature, this provides the basis for solving multi-variable coupling problems under high temperatures for the thermal exploitation of petroleum and safe disposal of nuclear waste.},

	abstract = {A detailed understanding of the thermal damage and failure mechanical behavior of granite at elevated temperatures is a key concern in nuclear waste disposal engineering, underground coal gasification, and heat mining in enhanced geothermal energy. In this research, uniaxial compression tests were first carried out to evaluate the effect of high temperature treatments (200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800°C) on the crack damage, strength and deformation failure behavior of a granite. The results demonstrated that, in all cases, the crack damage threshold, the strength and static elastic modulus of granite were increased at 300°C, before decreasing up to our maximum temperature of 800°C. However, the static Poisson’s ratio of granite first decreased at 600°C, and then increased rapidly with the temperature. The crack damage and peak axial strain always showed an increase when the temperature was increased. However, the dynamic elastic modulus decreased with the temperature, whereas the dynamic Poisson’s ratio did not depend on the temperature. The gradual increase of temperature results in a more ductile failure of granite. Next, the thermal damage mechanism of uncompressed granite was analyzed by optical microscopic observation. At T=25–300°C, the mechanisms were favored by the thermal expansion of mineral grains but no microcracks were observed; at T=400–600°C, the mechanisms were contributed by boundary cracks and transgranular cracks in feldspar and quartz grains; and at T=700–800°C, the mechanisms were associated with the coalescence of boundary cracks and transgranular cracks. The internal crack evolution process was then monitored during deformation using acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. The results showed that the cracking process of granite depended on the heat treatment temperature. Finally, the deformation mechanism of failed granite at various temperatures was analyzed using X-ray micro CT. During loading, the uniaxial compression stress direction dominated the more brittle fracture process of granite at T=25–600°C, which led to splitting tensile main cracks induced along the axial stress, and thermal damage determined the larger ductile fracture process of granite at T=700–800°C, which resulted in a more ductile deformation after the peak strength.},

The disposed canister produces residual heat that results from the decay of radionuclide's; increase the heat in the surrounding rock.The changes of mineral composition and pore water content of the rock after heating lead to the variation of the physical and mechanical properties of the host rock. In this study, an experiment was carried out to study the thermal effect (from 25 °C to 600 °C) on stress-strain behavior, elastic modulus, peak stress, thermal damage, and tensile strength of Jalore granite, India and compared with similar properties of granite from other countries. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses have been done to determine the changes in growth of thermal cracks due to heating of Jalore granite at different elevated temperature. Based on the temperature interval (between 25 °C and 600 °C) can be divided into two zones from 25 °C–300 °C to 300 °C–600 °C. It was observed that the compressive strength and tensile strength of rock increased as the temperature was gradually increased up to 300 °C, but decreased sharply above this temperature. In the temperature range of 300 °C–600 °C, stress-strain curves showed plasticity behavior in which brittle-ductile transition was observed. It was observed that thermally-inducedmicro-cracks because of its complexity in thermal expansivity, the densification stage is longer which increases the crack density rapidly, at the same time, the elastic modulus, compressive strength, and thermal damage are higher. Heating at high temperature will make the tensile strength of granite change due to the loss of water and minerals and the effect of thermal stress that the most conspicuous effect is the expansion of quartz.It is found that 300 °C is the critical temperature for Jalore granite above which the physicomechanical behavior reduces sharply. A very strong correlation was found between the compressive strength and tensile strength of Jalore granite rock with very high coefficients of determination.},

	abstract = {Superhot geothermal resources are widely distributed in the Earth's crust. However, due to the extremely low permeability of the deep reservoirs, mining the heat is challenging. It has been known that supercritical water fracturing can generate complex cloud-fracture networks in granite rocks. These complex cloud-fracture networks greatly improve the permeability of the low permeable rocks and are therefore desirable for superhot geothermal developments. To date, the performance of fracturing with supercritical water has been only verified in laboratory experiments and simulations at a laboratory scale. It is still unknown whether supercritical water fracturing can be used to induce such complex cloud-fracture networks in large-scale developments. In this study, we developed a sequential multiscale model to reproduce the fracturing behaviors induced by supercritical water injection by coupling a microscale model and a macroscale model. The microscale model simulates processes of fracture initiation and propagation on fine-scale subgrids. The macroscale model reflects the results from the microscale model and simulates the pressure and stress fields on a large scale. The results suggest that supercritical water fracturing can generate complex cloud-fracture networks even on a large scale under certain conditions. The performances of supercritical water fracturing are sensitive to geological conditions of the rock masses and injection conditions. Our simulation results show that SC-water fracturing has the potential to enhance permeability and provide sufficient heat exchange area in superhot geothermal resources.},

To clarify the crack propagation law of HDR fracturing, a 3D thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling simulation model of fracture propagation is produced based on the continuum–discontinuum element method (CDEM-THM3D). The correctness of the CDEM-THM3D model is validated by the theoretical solution of the nonisothermal soil consolidation model and Penny fracture model. Then, hydraulic fracturing numerical simulations are performed to analyse the influence of controlling variables on fracture propagation. The results indicate that the thermal tensile stress induced by injecting cold water can decrease reservoir fracture pressure and fracture extension pressure, causing an increasement in fracture width and a reduction in fracture length. Increasing thermal expansion coefficient and temperature difference enhances the effect of thermal stresses and even creates new branch fractures. A large elastic modulus favours an increase in fracture length, while large rock tensile strength and minimum horizontal stress lead to a decrease in fracture length. With increasing injection flow rate and fracturing fluid viscosity, the reservoir fracture pressure and the fracture width rise significantly, and the fracture easily breaks through the barrier of the high-stress compartment.},

	abstract = {The commercial viability of low-temperature geothermal basins is still a major stumbling block for field implementation of geothermal projects in India. Though there are several low-temperature basins, the presence of high-temperature gradient in few regions of India led to the hypothesis of testing the advanced geothermal potential in India. Therefore, this study holistically investigates the prospect of superhot rock geothermal potential in India vis-à-vis the techno-economical prospect and reservoir characteristics. Additionally, a comparative study is conducted with respect to the conventional geothermal system in the Son-Narmada-Tapti field to understand the effects of technical and economic parameters. The geothermal provinces in India can be utilized to reduce the use of fossil fuels for direct use and heating applications. However, geothermal resources suffer a setback due to high capital cost and risks associated with the feasibility of extraction process of heat energy. This study investigates the possibility of a superhot rock site to drive down the cost. To assess the technical feasibility, a comprehensive study is conducted using the reservoir heat and flow simulation for the proposed site. The study is conducted using the commercial package to obtain the heat energy that can be generated over the thirty years of injection and production. The feasibility analysis cannot be complete without the study of economic aspects. Hence, the market cost of electricity (LCOE) is estimated to understand the economic feasibility of the proposed superhot rock project. To get a better insight into the superhot rock potential, the resource potential and economic feasibility is compared with the similar system for the conventional geothermal prospect. The reservoir simulation study suggests that the dual superhot rock well system has capacity to provide 170 – 175 MWe in the region which is much higher than that of the conventional system (12 – 15 MWe). Also, it was observed that the dual well geothermal system, the waterfront does not reach the producer well over the thirty years of cold-water injection in both systems. The economic feasibility study shows that the levelized cost of electricity is most likely to be \$67/MWh which is significantly less than the conventional geothermal system (\$122/MWh).},

	abstract = {We have advanced phase-field simulation of hydraulic fracturing with consideration of thermoporoelasticity and discretization based on the mixed finite element in temperature, pressure, and the phase field. The key application is intended for hydraulic fracturing by water and by CO2 in hot dry rock. In geothermal fracturing, the injection fluid may have much lower temperature than the hot-volcanic rock and consideration of thermoporoelasticity may have a significant effect. We provide numerical simulations and comparison with laboratory data and examine the effect of thermoporoelasticity on breakdown pressure and fracture intensity. The thermal effect is more pronounced under unconfined conditions, especially for CO2 fracturing. The change of granite rock strength in the Brazilian tests at different temperatures without specific fluid confinement may not apply to high stress boundary conditions. Based on simulation of hydraulic fracturing experiments using water in heated and unheated granite, we conclude that the critical energy release rate Gc which is a key parameter of the phase field is not affected by temperature in the range of 20–300 °C. In that respect, there is similarity on the independency of Young’s modulus from temperature. The critical stress is, however, known to be a function of temperature. An important observation relates to simulation of fracturing by water and CO2 in a domain larger than laboratory scale. CO2 fills the created fractures quickly. Filling of created fractures by water takes time, and as a result fractures propagate in many stages. We observe from simulations that fracture intensity from CO2 is higher than by water in line with laboratory measurements. Higher fracture intensity and fracture surface area is an important consideration in renewable energy production from geothermal formations due to low thermal conductivity in volcanic rocks.},

	abstract = {The critical energy release rate of the crack is always set as an inherent material property (constant value) in the phase-field method (PFM) to depict the compression-shear and mixed-mode failures of the shale rock. However, the recent experimental results about supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) fracturing indicate that the degradation in strength of the porous medium is of significant importance because of the associated effect of fluid infiltration. To capture this tendency, a modified phase-field method is developed to fully consider the mixed-mode failure and shear strength degradation during the SC-CO2 fracturing (SCF) process. Precisely, the finite element method (FEM) is used to discretize the solution space and staggered scheme is employed to solve the system of non-linear equations derived from the proposed PFM. A new critical energy release rate criterion that considers the pore pressure gradient is generated and a distinction between two different failure modes (Mode-I and Mode-II) is made through the spectral decomposition of strain energy. The model is validated against experimental results and depicts the crack branching behavior with a wide range of fluid viscosities and injection rates. Tension and shear failure modes alternately dominate the behavior of branching, followed by periodic fluctuation of the crack tip velocity and equivalent driving term, which is quantitatively depicted by the phase diagram.},

Although this seismicity has generally been of low intensity, it has often reached a magnitude large enough to be felt by local inhabitants and cause damage, which has jeopardized the widespread deployment of this technology. In this chapter, we review some of the most relevant cases of induced seismicity in EGS and analyze the physical mechanisms that may lead to rock failure and, therefore, to the activation of earthquakes. Afterwards, we discuss the theories and approaches that have been used to model and forecast such seismicity.},

	abstract = {In this overview we report results of analysing induced seismicity in geothermal reservoirs in various tectonic settings within the framework of the European Geothermal Engineering Integrating Mitigation of Induced Seismicity in Reservoirs (GEISER) project. In the reconnaissance phase of a ﬁeld, the subsurface fault mapping, in situ stress and the seismic network are of primary interest in order to help assess the geothermal resource. The hypocentres of the observed seismic events (seismic cloud) are dependent on the design of the installed network, the used velocity model and the applied location technique. During the stimulation phase, the attention is turned to reservoir hydraulics (e.g., ﬂuid pressure, injection volume) and its relation to larger magnitude seismic events, their source characteristics and occurrence in space and time. A change in isotropic components of the full waveform moment tensor is observed for events close to the injection well (tensile character) as compared to events further away from the injection well (shear character). Tensile events coincide with high Gutenberg-Richter b-values and low Brune stress drop values. The stress regime in the reservoir controls the direction of the fracture growth at depth, as indicated by the extent of the seismic cloud detected. Stress magnitudes are important in multiple stimulation of wells, where little or no seismicity is observed until the previous maximum stress level is exceeded (Kaiser Effect). Prior to drilling, obtaining a 3D P-wave (Vp) and S-wave velocity (Vs) model down to reservoir depth is recommended. In the stimulation phase, we recommend to monitor and to locate seismicity with high precision (decametre) in real-time and to perform local 4D tomography for velocity ratio (Vp/Vs). During exploitation, one should use observed and model induced seismicity to forward estimate seismic hazard so that ﬁeld operators are in a position to adjust well hydraulics (rate and volume of the ﬂuid injected) when induced events start to occur far away from the boundary of the seismic cloud.},

The results of earlier cases indicate that the site characteristics, such as a transtensional type setting, are a key factor of successful EGS development. This study also introduces the Enhanced Geothermal Innovative Network for Europe (ENGINE), which focuses on developing high-temperature instruments for the characterization and exploitation of supercritical geothermal reservoirs, as well as the geothermal engineering integrating mitigation of induced seismicity in reservoirs (GEISER). The energy reserves in the upper 10km of the earth's crust are approximately 1.3 × 1027J, which could supply the global energy use for approximately 217 million years. The exploitable geothermal potential can reach 1200GWe based on an estimated probability of 70\%. In 2050, there will be more than 70 GWe of EGS based on an estimated probability of 85\%. In view of the immature technologies for EGS, the US has funded a total of 0.22 billion USD from 2007 to 2013 to develop innovative exploration, reservoir stimulation, and sustainable reservoir technologies and economic analysis models for the commercialization of EGS. The crucial issue in Taiwan's geothermal development is the enhancement of the poor productivity of geothermal production wells. Based on foreign experience, increasing the productivity by adding reinjection wells in traditional hydrothermal fields should be a feasible approach for the development of EGS in Taiwan. The study suggests that Taiwan should establish a geothermal exploration database. In addition, the enhancement of geothermal production by developing reservoir simulation and reservoir maintenance technologies will lead to cost reductions. Finally, promoting traditional hydrothermal geothermal power plants to drive EGS development will allow for the stable expansion of Taiwan's geothermal industry.},

	abstract = {Despite the wide application of hydraulic fracturing in enhanced geothermal system (EGS) development and unconventional hydrocarbon production, our understanding of the many factors affecting the propagation of hydraulic fractures has relied on circumstantial evidence. This is partly due to the scarcity of direct observations in the subsurface. The EGS Collab project attempts to address these issues in the context of EGS research by performing intermediate-scale (∼10 m) hydraulic stimulation experiments in a thoroughly characterized and heavily instrumented underground testbed. This paper analyzes the data collected from the first suite of hydraulic fracturing tests in this testbed, consisting of seven stimulation episodes. High-quality microseismic data delineate five planar features very clearly. Combining fracture-wellbore intersection observations from distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and visual observations from an open-hole well, as well as prior in-situ stress measurements, we conclude with high certainty that the four larger planes were hydraulic fractures. The growth of the hydraulic fractures was temporarily halted by a prominent, open natural fracture in the testbed but they eventually crossed and slightly reoriented under continued stimulation. Mineral-filled (i.e., healed) natural fractures, though prevalent in the testbed, did not have perceivable effects on hydraulic fracture propagation. The high-quality, mutually corroborating data sets allowed conclusions to be drawn with high confidence and attests to the advantage of intermediate-scale experiments in subsurface research.},

	abstract = {We review ten historical Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) projects and find that typically, during injection: (1) flow from the wellbore is from preexisting fractures, (2) bottomhole pressure exceeds the minimum principal stress, and (3) pressure-limiting behavior occurs. These observations are apparently contradictory because (1) is consistent with shear stimulation, but (2) and (3) suggest propagation of new fractures. To reconcile these observations, we propose that, in many cases, new fractures do not form at the wellbore, but away from the wellbore, and new fractures initiate from open and/or sliding natural fractures and propagate through the formation. Fracture initiation from natural fractures is aided by concentrations of stress caused by the fractures׳ opening and sliding. The propagating fractures may terminate against natural fractures, forming a complex network of both new and preexisting fractures. We perform computational modeling with a discrete fracture network simulator that couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation. The modeling results demonstrate that several geological conditions must be in place for stimulation to occur only through induced slip on preexisting fractures and to avoid significant opening of new or preexisting fractures. These conditions cannot be expected to be present at every EGS project, and our review of the literature shows that they typically are not. The simulation results indicate that pure shear stimulation is more likely to be possible in locations with thick faults present, and our review of the literature shows that EGS field experience is consistent with this hypothesis. We discuss field experiences from several EGS projects and describe how they are consistent with the idea that significant propagation of new fractures has occurred.},

Using an ultra-high frequency seismic network we detect seismic events as small as Mw {\textless} −4, revealing intricate details of a complex fracture network extending over 100 m from the injection sites. Here, we outline the experimental approach and present seismic catalogs as well as a comparative analysis of event number per injection, magnitudes, b-values, seismogenic index and reactivation pressures. In our first-order seismicity analysis, we could make the following observations: The rock volume impacted by the stimulations in different intervals differs significantly with a lateral extent from a few meters to more than 150 m. In most intervals multiple fractures were reactivated. The seismicity typically propagates upwards toward shallower depth on parallel oriented planes that are consistent with the stress field and seem to a large extent associated with preexisting open fractures. This experiment confirms the diversity in seismic behavior independent from the injection protocol. The overall seismicity patterns demonstrate that multi-stage stimulations using zonal isolation allow developing an extended fracture network in a 3D rock volume, which is necessary for enhanced geothermal systems. Our stimulations covering two orders of magnitude in terms of injected volume will give insights into upscaling of induced seismicity from underground laboratory scale to field scale.},

	abstract = {Geothermal energy, featured as a renewable low-carbon energy resource, exhibits great potential in mitigating global warming. However, efficient mining of geothermal energy from hot dry rock remains challenging due to the lack of a thermoporoelastic modeling approach that allows for integrated simulation of hydrofracturing and fluid circulation, and poor understanding of the mechanisms of hydraulic stimulations. To conquer these challenges, we propose an advanced modeling approach, which enables us to deal with the interplay between fluid transport, heat transfer, rock deformation, and three-dimensional fractures' growth and interaction. Based on the thermoporoelastic model, a refined investigation is performed to determine the hydrofracturing and fluid circulation processes, using data collected from the EGS Collab Experiment 1. This meso-scale testbed involves creating major hydraulic fractures, accompanied by numerous secondary hydroshearing fractures, hydraulically connecting two horizontal wellbores to build a fluid circulation system. All wellbores in the testbed were heavily instrumented with monitoring devices, offering high-quality data to properly constrain the geomechanical model. Our study provides insights into: (a) how the EGS Collab testbed responds to propagating fractures with strong stress shadowing and long-term injection of chilled water; (b) why the parallel pattern of two hydraulic fractures with a distance much smaller than the fracture dimension forms during multi-staged hydraulic stimulations; and (c) what the mechanisms are that determine hydrofracturing performance. Overall, this work not only contributes to a novel modeling approach for integrated simulation of hydrofracturing and fluid circulation, but advances our understanding of creating enhanced geothermal systems with interconnected fracture networks.},

We employed a triaxial direct shear method augmented with X-ray imaging to perform hydroshearing (injection-induced shearing) and mechanical shearing on naturally fractured specimens at in situ stress conditions. Measurements included fracture permeability, strength, stress-dependent aperture, shear dilation, and frictional strength. Results reveal that in situ natural fractures must be permeable, weak, and shear-oriented to be hydrosheared, and only a subset of the observable in situ fractures were suitable. When sheared, the fracture permeability typically increased by a factor of 10 or more and this increase was retained over time. However, shear slip did not always result in permeability increase. High phyllosilicate content associated with exceptionally weak fractures exhibited poor or even decreased permeability after stimulation. These measurements in combination with site data were used to conduct a slip-tendency analysis for different fracture sets, and we selected the top candidate natural fractures for hydroshearing at the EGS Collab sites. We also found that the lower in situ shear stress and stronger fractures at the E2 site make hydroshearing more challenging than at the E1 site. Overall, the methods and analysis used in our work can be applied to any geothermal project to identify in situ joint sets that are best suited for hydroshearing, which in turn can help to optimize well placement and energy production.},

	abstract = {The goal of hydraulic stimulation is to increase formation permeability in the near vicinity of a well. However, there remain technical challenges around measuring the outcome of this operation. During two enhanced geothermal system stimulations in South Australia, Paralana in 2011 and Habanero in 2003, extensive catalogs of microseismicity were recovered. It is often assumed that shear failure of existing fractures is the main mechanism behind both the induced earthquakes and any permeability enhancement. This underpins a common notion that the seismically active volume is also the stimulated reservoir. Here we compute the density of earthquake hypocenters and provide evidence that, under certain conditions, this spatiotemporal quantity is a reasonable proxy for pore pressure increase. We then apply an inverse modeling approach that uses the earthquake observations and a modified reservoir simulator to estimate the parameters of a permeability evolution relation. The regime implied by the data indicates that most permeability enhancement occurred very near to the wellbore and was not coincident with the bulk of the seismicity, whose volume was about 2 orders of magnitude larger. Thus, we conclude that, in some cases, it is possible for permeability enhancement and induced seismicity to be decoupled, in which case the seismically active volume is a poor indicator of the stimulated reservoir. Our results raise serious questions about the effectiveness of hydroshearing as a stimulation mechanism in enhanced geothermal system. This study extends our understanding of the complex processes linking earthquakes, fluid pressure, and permeability in both natural and engineered settings.},

	abstract = {The Utah Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) is a field‐scale enhanced geothermal system (EGS) laboratory for studying new techniques and strategies to overcome problems that have halted or hindered the broad application of EGS, including induced seismic activity and the cost‐efficient monitoring of EGS reservoirs. During the latest stimulation experiments in April 2024, we deployed a network of geophone patches to improve the (near‐) surface monitoring network. These patches consist of nine closely spaced nodal geophones. By stacking the waveforms within the patches, we obtain signal‐to‐noise ratios similar or superior to permanent seismic stations installed in 30 m deep boreholes or at the surface. That demonstrates that a patch setup is a valuable low‐cost option that temporarily improves the monitoring of induced or natural seismic activity. Using only the (near‐) surface networks, we map the growth of two main fracture zones in great detail during the seven‐stage stimulation of the injection well and the subsequent stimulation of the production well. We provide the first revised reference catalog for the April 2024 simulations at Utah FORGE with high‐quality relative relocations calibrated via previous high‐resolution absolute downhole locations. The microseismic data imply that the fracture zones constitute at least two isolated features that connect the two wells, forming efficient pathways for fluid to circulate between the injector and the producer.},

	abstract = {Complex cloud-fracture networks, favorable for enhanced geothermal system reservoir development, were shown to be able to be achieved in granite under superhot geothermal conditions, with temperatures of approximately 400–500 °C, by injecting low-viscosity water at these temperatures. Nonetheless, water utilization has several drawbacks, such as its reactivity with rock-forming minerals. Carbon dioxide (CO2), which has a low viscosity similar to that of the low-viscosity water under both superhot and lower-temperature conventional geothermal conditions, is a proposed replacement to overcome these challenges. This low viscosity of CO2 motivates its application to create cloud-fracture networks under various geothermal conditions. The present study, for the first time, demonstrated the formation of cloud-fracture networks in granite under both geothermal conditions through a set of CO2 fracturing experiments conducted from 200 to 450 °C under conventional and true triaxial stress states. The Griffith failure criterion was shown to be applicable for the formation of a cloud-fracture network in both geothermal conditions because it indicated that the fracture network was formed by the stimulation of pre-existing microfractures. The formation of cloud-fracture networks has potential advantages, such as additional fracturing in the presence of sizable natural fractures and a lower risk of induced seismicity; however, CO2 fracturing has the challenge of narrower fracture apertures under conventional geothermal conditions, which should be addressed in future research.},

We describe the results of time and depth processing and interpretation of legacy 2D reflection seismic lines acquired in 1998 to study the deep structures of the caldera in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The study is relevant for the geophysical characterization of the subsurface in this area, where no vertical seismic profiles are available but only two short sonic well logs. The interpretation of selected seismic horizons in the seismic depth profiles was first determined by the local geological model of the curved caldera and then calibrated by the stratigraphy of the boreholes and the matching of the 2D seismic lines crossing points. The processing outcomes are depth-migrated profiles, the corresponding P-wave velocities and the updated geological models. The main results are the representation of the basement and the identification of the structural make-up of the main units with some of the main faults of the collapsed caldera. Our results provide new insights into the subsurface geometry of volcanic collapses and the geothermal field contained within them at the caldera scale.},

Our investigation indicates presence of super-critical thermal regime (378°C) at about 4 km depth and the MT analysis indicate shallow magma chamber at about 5 km depth. The crust is relatively thin below this region with the low-velocity region located at depth of about 36 km. Thermo-Hydro-mechanical model investigation has been carried out using finite element discretization technique. For faulted zone reservoir models, 30 years of geothermal energy exploitation does not cause thermal breakthrough for mass flow rates up to 500 kg/s, however, the mean stress developed in the reservoir becomes much larger and may be unsustainable for the reservoir stability. To ensure the success of a fractured reservoir model, the use of multiple wellbores is recommended. In the case of a closed-loop geothermal system, the primary concern is the control of thermoelastic stress. This can be achieved either by increasing the wellbore depth while reducing the injection mass flow rate, or by extending the wellbore's horizontal component. The outlet temperature in both the cases maintained at 275°C. This is the first time a superhot EGS site has been identified in Türkiye.},

	url = {https://dx.doi.org/},
	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Major challenges are encountered in the design and construction of deep superhot ({\textgreater}300°C) geothermal wells due to higher temperatures and pressure, and increased corrosiveness of the geothermal fluid. The corrosiveness of the geothermal fluid is due to the chemical composition which includes corrosive gases such as HCl, H2S and CO2. In this study L80-type 1 carbon steel and L80-13Cr stainless steel API casing materials were tested in a simulated superhot geothermal well environment at 350°C in water with Cl, H2S and CO2 for 168 hrs. in both vapor and liquid phases in high temperature and high pressure (HTHP) autoclave to investigate their corrosion behavior. The results showed that both API casing materials, L80- type 1 and L80-13Cr, were prone to corrosion attack in the simulated superhot deep geothermal well environment. The L80 grade Type 1 carbon steel tested in the liquid phase exhibited the highest corrosion rate and demonstrated vulnerability to localized corrosion or cracking in both liquid and vapor phases. Similarly, the L80 grade 13Cr stainless steel is not considered a suitable choice for harsh environments rich in H2S, CO2, and Cl at superheated temperatures. While it was prone to localized corrosion, it exhibited a low uniform corrosion rate ({\textless}0.1 mm/year).INTRODUCTION. Several projects around the world are exploring the potential of utilizing geothermal energy from superhot and supercritical geothermal resources, these include for example the GeoMex project in Mexico, the Japan Beyond Brittle Project (JBBP) in Japan, the Iceland Deep Drilling project (IDDP) in Iceland, and the Newberry Deep Drilling Project (NDDP) in the USA.1 The objective of many of these projects is to obtain superhot or supercritical geothermal fluid (T{\textgreater} 300°C, P {\textgreater}100 bar) by drilling deeper geothermal wells ({\textgreater}3 km). The goal of these projects is in general to obtain higher power output per well, higher than for traditional high temperature wells. With this method the likelihood of encountering highly corrosive fluids increases as well as the risk of well failure. Due to higher temperatures ({\textgreater}300°C) and the increased likelihood of the geothermal fluid being highly corrosive; corrosion and erosion-corrosion are expected as experienced in deep superhot geothermal wells drilled in the past2-3,4-5. In vapor dominated geothermal systems (T{\textgreater}300°C) highly corrosive gases such H2S, CO2 and HCl are often present. This can cause severe corrosion problems because carbon-steel casings corrode at accelerated rates upon the condensation of the super-heated steam with these corrosive gases. In the first well of the IDDP project, in the IDDP-1 well in Krafla, the presence of H2S, CO2 and HCl in the superheated steam caused operational difficulties.2,3 Before the well had to be quenched due to failure of the well casings and wellhead material testing on-site were done in the IDDP-1 well geothermal steam4,5. After the initial discharging period the IDDP-1 well was discharging dry superheated steam from the wellhead which had high temperature (450°C) and pressure (140 bar). For the material testing unit (test rack in the pipeline) in the superheated steam the temperature and pressure had decreased to about 350°C and 12-13 bars. The steam was supersaturated with silica which in turn caused silica deposition from the steam when the temperature and pressure dropped. The corrosion test results showed that all samples tested, including the carbon steel casing materials (K55, TN95), Ni-alloys (N06255 and N06625) and titanium alloys (R50400 and R52400) had very low uniform corrosion rates ({\textless} 0.01 mm/year) but all the samples were prone to some localized corrosion damages, i.e. cracking, pitting or both.4,5 Further testing could not be done on-site due to corrosion and failure of valves in the wellhead equipment and casings after several months of discharging.},

Hydraulic fracturing in these fields poses distinct challenges to design and forecasting the fracturing outcome. This is rooted in the geomechanics aspects of these reservoirs and the high temperature conditions along with specific well completions strategies. In this paper, we present recent experiences in these two fields and present data and analysis to help better understand the stimulation and the resulting SRV and fracture geometries. We examine two conceptual models for hydraulic stimulation of geothermal reservoir namely, hydraulic fracture propagation and shear stimulation. We use fully coupled, 3D thermo-poroelastic DD method which considers planar and non-planar fracture propagation and interactions with natural fractures. We show that asymmetric and exotic growth behavior is to be expected in the stress regimes encountered in these reservoirs and completions styles used. We also assess the reservoir growth during circulation experiments with reference to effective reservoir management and power production strategies.},

Casing integrity challenges for high and super-high temperature geothermal wells were first discussed. A simplified well cement material model was implemented in the stand-alone code, Casinteg, to simulate cement behaviour in field conditions. Numerical simulations were performed, based on the IDDP-2 well scenarios, to investigate the effect of cement retarders, cement hydration heat and cement shrinkage on the casing stresses. The obtained results have shown that by engineering proper cement solutions, the risks of casing failure in geothermal wells can be minimized to sustainably harvesting green power from superhot geothermal reservoirs.1.

In Los Humeros, the seismic velocity models were derived from the inversion of legacy active seismic survey data acquired in 1998, as well as from passive seismic monitoring and ambient seismic noise interferometry carried out during 2017–2019 by the GEMex consortium. In the Acoculco EGS, ambient seismic noise data were used. Steady-state formation temperatures were re-evaluated during and after the end of the GEMex project using measurements provided as a courtesy of the Federal Electricity Commission of Mexico (CFE). The density data needed for the calculation of elastic moduli were provided by the GEMex consortium, as derived from the inversion of regional and local gravity surveys. The analysis indicated that statistically significant correlations of seismic parameters to temperature exist in the vertical direction, namely exponential in Los Humeros superhot and logarithmic in Acoculco EGS, but no correlation was evident in the horizontal direction. This result suggests an indirect relationship among the considered variables due to interdependence on other parameters, such as pressure and vapor saturation. As the analysis was performed using only data obtained from sensing-at-surface methods, without direct geophysical calibration at depth, a distributed fiber-optic seismic and temperature sensing system at both surface and downhole is proposed for active-source and passive seismic monitoring, and seismic-while-drilling by the drill-bit source is considered for reverse vertical seismic profile (RVSP) recording whenever possible for future high-temperature geothermal applications.},

	abstract = {Summary Geothermal wells drilled into a supercritical geothermal resource, where temperature exceeds the critical temperature of water (∼374 ºC) could generate an order of magnitude higher power output than the majority of conventional geothermal wells. However, the best strategy for supercritical resource utilization - direct production of single phase fluid, or injection of cold water to expand the potential resource, or a combination of both - has remained unclear. Due to the strong, non-linear temperature and pressure dependence of fluid properties at supercritical conditions as well as the strongly varying rock properties near a magmatic heat source, numerical simulation of such resource utilization has remained challenging as these characteristics preclude common simplifications typically used in geothermal reservoir modelling. In this work we address these challenges and present reconnaissance 3D numerical simulations of a geothermal system evolution from the time of magma emplacement and through a subsequent formation of a supercritical geothermal resource. The simulations of two-phase liquid-vapor flow with boiling are performed using the 3D extension of the Control Volume Finite Element Method (CVFEM) [1] within the CSMP++ software library [2] together with an accurate equation of state for H2O-NaCl valid in a broad temperature (0 to 1000 ºC) and pressure (1 to 5000 bar) range [3]. The CVFEM scheme is locally mass-conservative and is able to capture strong gradients in fluid properties arising at the contact between a magmatic intrusion and the host rock. The magmatic heat source is explicitly represented as a region of an unstructured mesh and its permeability varies with temperature mimicking the brittle-ductile transition of a basaltic rock. The potential supercritical resource is targeted by a well or a group of wells, direct production from and cold water injection into the geothermal reservoir is modelled. To do so we have implemented a Peaceman-like well model for the 3D CVFEM. We benchmarked our numerical well model against an analytical solution and tested it for mesh size convergence at supercritical conditions. Our reconnaissance simulations provide the first glimpse into the response of a supercritical resource to operation with wells. P. Weis et al., Geofluids 2014, 14, 3. S.K.

All samples develop an S–C′ fabrics and deformation localizes in slip zones containing ‘amorphous’ feldspar material with an intermediate composition (Na, Ca and K-rich). Further, we observe changes in composition of feldspars (enrichment in the albite component) in the highly fragmented – but crystalline – regions with increasing finite shear strain. Our results indicate that mass-transfer processes keep pace with frictional deformation even at high strain rates and together with viscous flow of the ‘amorphous’ material are responsible for the observed strength difference.},

	abstract = {Geothermal energy recovery from deep rock formations could significantly contribute to world energy demand by enabling sustainable and renewable energy resources. However, traditional reservoir development methods such as large-scale hydraulic stimulation have faced significant environmental and technical challenges, including reservoir damage, groundwater and surface pollution, high water consumption, and induced seismicity. Carbon dioxide foam is an attractive novel alternative for reservoir stimulation for oil/gas and geothermal energy recovery, while also offering the additional benefit of CO₂ sequestration. However, the applicability of CO₂ foam under deep underground conditions presents a significant challenge that requires comprehensive understanding. The study aims to explore the critical scientific potentials and challenges of CO₂ foam for reservoir stimulation, particularly in high-temperature and high-pressure environments. The foam decay process is critically assessed, encompassing critical mechanisms such as liquid drainage, coarsening and coalescence, which are influenced by temporal, pressure, and temperature variables. Recent studies report that the addition of optimal small quantities of different additives, including surfactant, polymer, and nanoparticles, enhances the physio-chemical properties of the foam and reduces foam decay at high temperatures. Surfactants like C22-tailed tertiary amine, N-erucamidopropyl-N,N-dimethylamine (UC₂₂AMPM), Oleylamidopropyldimethyl Betaine (OAPB) and Alpha-Olefin Sulphonates (AOS) with Cocamidopropyl Betaine (TEGO) have shown promising stability at 100 °C, while polymers like Partially Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide (HPAM) and Guar gum improve stability but may degrade at high temperatures. Nanoparticle (NP) stabilised foam offers superior stability, though it is also affected by time and temperature. Previous studies have shown contradictory results on the influence of pressure on CO₂ foam highlighting the need for further comprehensive research. This paper also reviews pilot studies that have reported the successful implementation of CO₂ foam at natural gas recovery, offering insights that could be applied to geothermal energy recovery. Overall, the paper offers a systematic review of the recent innovations aimed at enhancing CO₂ foam performance under high-temperature high-pressure deep reservoir conditions and proposes future research directions and recommendations for novel additive combinations.},

	abstract = {The goal of this project was to develop a new CO2 injection enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) process using engineered nanoparticles with optimized surface coatings that has better volumetric sweep efficiency and a wider application range than conventional CO2-EOR processes. The main objectives of this project were to (1) identify the characteristics of the optimal nanoparticles that generate extremely stable CO2 foams in situ in reservoir regions without oil; (2) develop a novel method of mobility control using “self-guiding” foams with smart nanoparticles; and (3) extend the applicability of the new method to reservoirs having a wide range of salinity, temperatures, and heterogeneity. Concurrent with our experimental effort to understand the foam generation and transport processes and foam-induced mobility reduction, we also developed mathematical models to explain the underlying processes and mechanisms that govern the fate of nanoparticle-stabilized CO2 foams in porous media and applied these models to (1) simulate the results of foam generation and transport experiments conducted in beadpack and sandstone core systems, (2) analyze CO2 injection data received from a field operator, and (3) aid with the design of a foam injection pilot test. Our simulator is applicable to near-injection well field-scale foam injection problems and accounts for the effects due to layered heterogeneity in permeability field, foam stabilizing agents effects, oil presence, and shear-thinning on the generation and transport of nanoparticle-stabilized C/W foams. This report presents the details of our experimental and numerical modeling work and outlines the highlights of our findings.},

	abstract = {The inherent characteristic of unconventional and ultra-low permeability reservoirs is a small drainage area that negatively affects the production rate and ultimate recovery (UR). Drilling horizontal wells, coupled with a stimulation process such as hydraulic fracturing, are applied to wells in these reservoirs to enhance well productivity. Although hydraulic fracturing has been the most famous stimulation technique in these reservoirs and has contributed to the increased US oil and gas production during the last several years, other stimulation techniques may be competitive with (or complementary to) hydraulic fracturing. This is because the main contribution to production in these reservoirs would be from complex fracture networks (often micro-cracks) combined with enhanced formation permeability rather than the classical two-wing fractures. Hence, a near-wellbore stimulation technique for improving the permeability of these reservoirs by activating the existing natural fractures and creating secondary microfractures would be highly desired. This paper investigates the pulse plasma stimulation technique to investigate such an approach of waterless stimulation/fracturing that creates multiple fractures and is also a permeability enhancement method. In this method, plasma is generated by discharging a high voltage and high current electrical energy in a very short time into two electrodes submerged in a wellbore filled with aqueous fluid. This study is divided into two sections. The first part presents experimental and numerical examples of stimulation/fracturing induced by pulse plasma in different rocks. Several parameters, including the effect of discharge with and without wire, input energy, confining stress, and rock type, on the induced fractures are studied. The second part uses the insights and results from the first part to numerically investigate pulse plasma's effects on production. Measurement of the formation permeability around the generated fractures indicated that the shock wave generated multiple fractures and increased the rock permeability by more than one or two orders of magnitude. The second part of the numerical section discusses the increased estimated rate and ultimate recovery (EUR) of horizontal wellbores due to fracturing and modified permeability resulting from pulse plasma. We present a sensitivity analysis on the magnitude and extent of the improved permeability region and its impact on EUR.},

	abstract = {Recent technological advances to trigger high-energy seismic waves from within the wellbore have spurred interest in their potential application to induce fracturing within deep subsurface formations. Although a considerable body of experimental observations at the bench scale (on the order of 1 cubic foot) show promise, there remains considerable uncertainty in how the process may scale to the field. This work characterizes the relationship between the extent and intensity of fracturing and the duration and strength of the dynamic load. Our approach uses a direct numerical simulation of the elastodynamic equations while accounting for nonlinear fracture mechanics. A hybrid Finite-Discrete Element Method (FDEM) is applied whereby cohesive (elastoplastic) laws hold mesh elements together until complete failure. Beyond failure, elements act as deformable free bodies that can interact via contact constraints, including friction. The consistency of the model is first verified and it is validated with observations from previously reported physical experiments. Subsequently, we apply the model to conduct a numerical exploration of the dimensionless parameter space that defines plausible loading waveforms. We model an infinite domain that contains a spherical inclusion within which various impulsive loads are applied. The dynamic loading waveform is parameterized by its rise time to peak stress, followed by a decay period, and occurring within micro- to milliseconds. The dimensionless parameter space is sampled by varying loading characteristics (rise time, peak pressure, and impulse) to reveal the stimulated damaged bulk volume and crack intensity. Consistent with reported experimental observations, the model reproduces a nearly linear trend between the radius of damage and the maximum stress on the bench scale. Beyond that scale, however, the model predicts that this scaling slows considerably to a fractional power law between the damaged radius and the peak stress. This limitation coincides with a geometric increase in the intensity of damage within the stimulated volume. We present loci curves of the expected damage radii as functions of the loading waveform properties.},

	abstract = {This work presents a numerical study incorporating the impact of temperature variations along the fracture on the viscosity of fracturing fluids and consequently on proppant distribution in hydraulic fracturing. Traditional models have not considered non-uniform temperature distributions, resulting in less accurate predictions of proppant migration and distribution. The proposed model integrates the thermal variations to enhance the understanding of proppant dynamics under realistic field conditions. The proposed model is validated through physical experiments, demonstrating significant differences in proppant placement due to temperature- induced viscosity changes. Our results show that proppant distribution is substantially affected by lower temperatures at the fracture opening and higher temperatures at the distal end, contrasting sharply with distribution patterns observed under uniform viscosity conditions. As the temperature at the fracture opening decreases, the viscosity of the fracturing fluid increases, enhancing its capacity to transport proppant. The increased viscosity facilitates the transport of proppant deeper into the fracture, resulting in a reduction of the total amount of proppant near the fracture opening and a smaller stacking angle compared to those observed at fixed viscosities of 10, 100, and 200 mPa sThe findings offer critical insights into the mechanics of proppant flow, holding substantial theoretical and practical implications for optimizing hydraulic fracturing treatments.},

The project conducted a 10-stage stimulation, employing variable cluster spacing and diverse stimulation techniques. In a 30-day circulation test performed in August 2024, the results showed significant fracture connectivity and about 90\% fluid recovery, emphasizing the effectiveness of the stimulation strategy. To understand reservoir behavior, numerical modeling with a representation of the fracture network is essential. One of the widely adopted approaches is the use of Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) models, which integrate microseismic event (MEQ) data, core samples, and well logs to provide detailed fracture characterization. DFN models are best suited for representing the system's geologic attributes. However, performing numerical simulations using these DFN models may require substantial computational resources. This study introduces a simplified planar fracture model, developed based on strain measurements during stimulation obtained from Distributed Strain Sensing (DSS). This computationally efficient method aims to replicate reservoir behavior using a uniform grid representation. This planar fracture modeling approach was first validated by comparing simulated inlet pressure data against DFN models. While field observations revealed transient operational variability and reservoir heterogeneities, the planar model effectively simulated thermal response in the history matching of the 30-day circulation test. This study shows the usefulness of simplified planar models for history matching and enabling EGS system simulations.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Utah FORGE (Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy) is a U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored field laboratory for demonstrating and promoting the feasibility of hydraulically fracturing thermally conductive granite (or similar) formations to create an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS). One embodiment of an EGS, as adopted at FORGE, is to drill injection and production wells and interconnect them with hydraulic fracturing to form a subsurface heat exchange system. Three small fracturing treatments in the injection well were carried out in April 2022. In April 2024, eight fracturing stages were pumped in the injection well, and four fracturing stages were pumped in a vertically offset but parallel, sub-horizontal production well. The static bottomhole temperature is 430°F. The stages in the production well were perforated based on fracture intersections or proximity detected by fiber optics that had been previously cemented on the outside of the casing string in that well.To establish optimal procedures for treating granitic or similar reservoirs, the eight stages incorporated several variables to test, at least on a preliminary basis. These variables included stage volume, proppant placement, testing an ultralightweight proppant (ULWP), fluids – slickwater versus crosslinked carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl guar (XL CMHPG), and the number of perforation clusters.Most stages treated well, some verging on screening out. In two stages, proppant was not pumped as the treating pressure reached the maximum allowable surface pressure before achieving a pump rate sufficient to successfully carry proppant. This suggested unexpected geologic differences in this granitoid batholith. Regardless, all other stages treated well and are described. Silica sand was chosen for the proppant since the FORGE wells are not going to be used for commercial purposes.This is one of the few times that wells have been intentionally interconnected successfully. There was some success at the Fenton Hill project in the 1980s and Fervo Energy successfully interconnected wells in a geothermal play in Nevada. Fervo Energy has also started development of a new EGS project offsetting the Utah FORGE acreage. The importance of fiber optics is documented, along with the role of stimulating both wells and characteristic treating records for the production well. A nine-hour circulation test performed immediately after stimulation treatments confirmed significant hydraulic connectivity between the two wells. A successful longer-term circulation test conducted three months after the stimulation program is also described. Efficiency built to about 90\% before a planned shutdown and flowing temperature tracked increasing flow rate from the production well – reaching a maximum of 385°F.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Geological carbon sequestration requires injecting CO2 into the deep formation through wellbores with an injection rate as high as {\textasciitilde}1 Mt/year. This process can lead to substantial temperature drops near the wellbore, potentially causing the cement debonding from the casing or formation, resulting in severe leakage. In this paper, we first analyzed the transient wellbore temperature and pressure profile across the well's depth using both an analytical model and one dynamic multiphase flow simulator, with cross validation. We then adapted these results for the subsequent well integrity analysis using a fully coupled thermoporoelastic model with transient solutions. Our analysis shows that the cooling effect depends on injection rate, surface CO2 temperature, and reservoir pressure. For a simulated Class VI well, a combination of high injection rate, low surface CO2 temperature, and depleted reservoir could result in the wellbore temperature that close to the bottom dropping by 60 ℃. Similar significant cooling scenarios have been observed at the Aquistore field located in Canada, the Alwyn field, and the Goldeneye field in the U.K. The maximum allowable cooling temperature for a typical cement formulation with 10 GPa elastic modulus, and 0.15 Poisson's ratio is 40 ℃. Therefore, this cooling effect could compromise wellbore integrity and cause well leakage through cement-casing debonding. Multiple practical strategies have been found to enhance cement integrity during CO2 injection, including modifying cement formulation to be more ductile and resilient, enhancing the initial state of stress in the cement using a pre-stressing method or expansive additive, and adding an insulated coating layer to the tubing. Pre-heating CO2 at the surface is effective but can be expensive and impractical. Using a protective annulus fluid with a lower thermal conductivity and a new tubing material with low thermal conductivity have been found to be ineffective. Overall, our comprehensive analysis enables us to assess the long-term impacts of CO2 injection on well integrity and promote sustainable and effective geological carbon sequestrations with proper environmental protection protocols.},

Thus, an alternative is to use foam-based fracturing fluid which offers potential advantage over conventional water-based fracturing fluid such as minimum water usage, reduced wellbore damage, high proppant carrying capacity, and less environmental damage. However, foams are complex mixture of gaseous phase and liquid phase which are thermodynamically unstable at downhole conditions, and their stability can decrease over time due to liquid drainage, bubble coarsening, and coalescence. This paper shows laboratory experiments executed to study foam stability at high temperature (200 °C) and high pressure (6.9 MPa) conditions which simulates the geothermal environment. Foam stability was characterized by half-life of foam, which is defined as the time taken by the foam to decreases by 50\% of its original height due to drainage. In this paper, two types of gaseous phases, nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were investigated. Also, based on successful practice of foam-based fracturing fluid in oil and gas industries, four surfactants, including Alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS), Sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS), Tergitol™ (NP – 40), and Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) at optimum concentration of 1 wt.\% were tested for best stability performance. In addition, different stabilizing agents including guar gum, bentonite clay, crosslinker, silicon dioxide nanoparticles (SiO2), graphene oxide (GO) were also studied. Experimental results showed that N2 foams were more stable than CO2 foams. It was observed that foam half-life decreased with the increase in temperature. Among all the surfactants, AOS foams showed the most promising thermal stability at high temperatures. Moreover, with the addition of stabilizing agents, foam's half-life was enhanced. Stabilizing agents such as crosslinker and GO dispersion showed the most stable foams with half-life recorded at 20 min and 17 min, respectively, at 200 °C and 6.9 MPa. Finally, pressure also showed a positive effect on foam stability; with increased pressure, foam half-life was increased. Based on the experimental data, analytical models for the effect of temperature and pressure were developed, considering foam degradation is a first-order kinetic reaction that linearly depends on the foam drainage mechanism. The effect of temperature on foam half-life was studied as an exponential decay model. In this model, foam half-life is a function of drainage rate constant (DA) and activation energy (Ea) of the foam system. The effect of pressure on foam half-life was found to obey a power-law model where an increase in pressure showed an increase in foam half-life. Furthermore, a linear relation was studied for the effect of pressure on foam activation energy and drainage rate. Then the combined effects of temperature and pressure were studied, which yielded an analytical model to predict the foam stabilities in terms of half-life for different foam compositions. This research indicates that with an appropriate selection of surfactants and stabilizing agents, it is possible to obtain stable foams, which could replace conventional water fracturing fluid under EGS conditions.},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolution process including foaming, stabilization and ageing of CO2 aqueous foams in high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP) environments is crucial for their rational use. However, most studies have been conducted through macroscopic observation, leading to inadequate insight into their intrinsic mechanisms. Herein we attempt to gain a comprehensive understanding of the evolution process by a combination of HTHP visualization foam meter, HTHP small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and HTHP rheometry. A C22-tailed tertiary amine, N-erucamidopropyl-N,N-dimethylamine (UC22AMPM), was first employed to develop robust CO2 foams. It was found the volume and lifetime of UC22AMPM-CO2 foams decrease by 24.7\% and 56.9\%, respectively, as the temperature rises from 25 °C to 100 °C at 8.5 MPa. The deterioration of the foam properties at elevated temperatures is attributed to the continuous phase viscosity reduced from 70 mPa·s to 25 mPa·s, leading to faster drainage, as well as to the coarsening rate increased from 6.60 × 104 to 9.83 × 105 μm3 min−1, concomitant with the change in bubbles shapes, indicting enhanced coarsening and coalescence. Likewise, the decrease in pressure from 10 MPa to 1 MPa also resulted in a 46.7\% and 91.0\% reduction in foam volume and lifetime at 100 °C, respectively. The impairment in foam properties with decreasing pressure also comes from the decrement of continuous phase viscosity, accelerating the drainage and thereby lowering the liquid fraction in the foam. The decreasing liquid fraction entails the liquid film to thin and weak, enhancing coarsening of bubbles and their merging. Our findings improve the insights into the foam evolution and pave a new road towards more comprehensive characterization of CO2 foam under HTHP conditions.},

	abstract = {Geothermal energy provides clean, steady and renewable electricity and heat, but the use of geothermal energy has conventionally been constrained to locations with adequate subsurface heat and fluid flow. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) enable geothermal energy usage in unconventional areas by enhancing the subsurface permeability and increasing fluid flow, which is then extracted as a carrier of the thermal energy. In this Review, we discuss the development of EGS and its role in providing energy. Some EGS are operating commercially in Europe and provide heat and/or electricity, but technical issues and concerns over induced seismicity have historically hindered the broader expansion of EGS. Adaptation of advanced drilling techniques (including the use of polycrystalline diamond compact bits, multiwell drilling pads, horizontal drilling and multistage stimulation) is enabling an increase in scale and decrease in cost of EGS projects. As a result, in the USA, enhanced geothermal is expected to achieve plant capital costs (US\$4,500 kW−1) and a levelized cost of electricity (US\$80 MWh−1) that are competitive with market electricity prices by 2027. With further development of EGS to manage induced seismicity risk and increase system flexibility, EGS could provide stable baseload and potentially dispatchable electricity in clean energy systems.},

During the latest stimulation experiments in April 2024, we deployed a network of geophone patches to improve the (near‐) surface monitoring network. These patches consist of nine closely spaced nodal geophones. By stacking the waveforms within the patches, we obtain signal‐to‐noise ratios similar or superior to permanent seismic stations installed in 30 m deep boreholes or at the surface. That demonstrates that a patch setup is a valuable low‐cost option that temporarily improves the monitoring of induced or natural seismic activity. Using only the (near‐) surface networks, we map the growth of two main fracture zones in great detail during the seven‐stage stimulation of the injection well and the subsequent stimulation of the production well. We provide the first revised reference catalog for the April 2024 simulations at Utah FORGE with high‐quality relative relocations calibrated via previous high‐resolution absolute downhole locations. The microseismic data imply that the fracture zones constitute at least two isolated features that connect the two wells, forming efficient pathways for fluid to circulate between the injector and the producer.},

The combination of microfluidic devices with X-ray fluorescence microprobe spectroscopy may address this need, but typical materials used in these devices attenuate the X-rays needed to analyze key elements of interest, such as Fe or As. In this work, a method is presented for fabricating an etched silicon microfluidic device that is sealed with a 30 µm thin glass window that is sufficiently transparent for X-ray fluorescence microprobe spectroscopy. The capabilities of these devices for X-ray microprobe spectroscopy are demonstrated using an Fe (hydr)oxide solid that is loaded with As and then infused with sulfide, on beamline 4-BM at NSLS-II, resulting in time-variant Fe precipitation reactions and As sorption. Key results include in situ X-ray fluorescence time-series maps of Fe, As and a Br flow tracer, as well as spot XANES at both the Fe K edge and As K edge. Additionally, multiple energy mapping is used to examine the spatial speciation of As over time. The results of this work clearly demonstrate the capabilities of this novel microfluidic system that can be analyzed using X-ray fluorescence microprobe spectroscopy and can be made to study a wide range of complex microscale geochemical systems.},

	abstract = {Mineral dissolution significantly impacts many geological systems. Carbon released by diagenesis, carbon sequestration, and acid injection are examples where geochemical reactions, fluid flow, and solute transport are strongly coupled. The complexity in these systems involves interplay between various mechanisms that operate at timescales ranging from microseconds to years. Current experimental techniques characterize dissolution processes using static images that are acquired with long measurement times and/or low spatial resolution. These limitations prevent direct observation of how dissolution reactions progress within an intact rock with spatially heterogeneous mineralogy and morphology. We utilize microfluidic cells embedded with thin rock samples to visualize dissolution with significant temporal resolution (100 ms) in a large observation window (3 × 3 mm). We injected acidic fluid into eight shale samples ranging from 8 to 86 wt \% carbonate. The pre- and postreaction microstructures are characterized at the scale of pores (0.1 to 1 µm) and fractures (1 to 1,000 µm). We observe that nonreactive particle exposure, fracture morphology, and loss of rock strength are strongly dependent on both the relative volume of reactive grains and their distribution. Time-resolved images of the rock unveil the spatiotemporal dynamics of dissolution, including two-phase flow effects in real time and illustrate the changes in the fracture interface across the range of compositions. Moreover, the dynamical data provide an approach for characterizing reactivity parameters of natural heterogeneous samples when porous media effects are not negligible. The platform and workflow provide real-time characterization of geochemical reactions and inform various subsurface engineering processes.},

The results of earlier cases indicate that the site characteristics, such as a transtensional type setting, are a key factor of successful EGS development. This study also introduces the Enhanced Geothermal Innovative Network for Europe (ENGINE), which focuses on developing high-temperature instruments for the characterization and exploitation of supercritical geothermal reservoirs, as well as the geothermal engineering integrating mitigation of induced seismicity in reservoirs (GEISER). The energy reserves in the upper 10km of the earth's crust are approximately 1.3 × 1027J, which could supply the global energy use for approximately 217 million years. The exploitable geothermal potential can reach 1200GWe based on an estimated probability of 70\%. In 2050, there will be more than 70 GWe of EGS based on an estimated probability of 85\%. In view of the immature technologies for EGS, the US has funded a total of 0.22 billion USD from 2007 to 2013 to develop innovative exploration, reservoir stimulation, and sustainable reservoir technologies and economic analysis models for the commercialization of EGS. The crucial issue in Taiwan's geothermal development is the enhancement of the poor productivity of geothermal production wells. Based on foreign experience, increasing the productivity by adding reinjection wells in traditional hydrothermal fields should be a feasible approach for the development of EGS in Taiwan. The study suggests that Taiwan should establish a geothermal exploration database. In addition, the enhancement of geothermal production by developing reservoir simulation and reservoir maintenance technologies will lead to cost reductions. Finally, promoting traditional hydrothermal geothermal power plants to drive EGS development will allow for the stable expansion of Taiwan's geothermal industry.},

	abstract = {As one of the most energy-intensive industries, mining faces challenges related to energy inefficiency, safety, and sustainability. These challenges prompt exploration of alternative methods, among which microwave-assisted mining stands out as significant. While existing research suggests the potential benefits of microwave treatment in mining, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding its field application. This study aims to address two key gaps in current knowledge: firstly, by examining the holistic impact of microwave treatment across the entire mine-to-mill process rather than focusing solely on individual operations, and secondly, by evaluating the energy efficiency of applying microwave treatment in the field, considering the energy required for microwave irradiation as a design factor. A novel methodology is introduced to capture the effect of microwave treatment in one operation on the subsequent ones, using a comprehensive set of experiments encompassing microwave treatment, calorimetric measurement, uniaxial compressive strength, rock cutting, and crushing tests. The results reveal that using microwave treatment in one operation has significant implications on subsequent ones, leading to an exponential increase in energy efficiency, which can be more than ten folds in some cases. Additionally, utilizing the energy efficiency-based approach, the achieved improvements are discussed per unit of input microwave energy, shedding new light on established concepts such as the effect of power and exposure time on the efficiency of microwave treatment. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of microwave treatment as a viable rock pre-conditioning method, aiming to lead the industry toward more sustainable mining practices.},

	abstract = {Electronic equipment in data centers generates heat during operation, which should be dissipated through a cooling system to prevent overheating and maintain optimal performance. Electricity consumption for the data center cooling system becomes significant as the demand for data-intensive services increases. Although various technologies have been developed and integrated into the data center cooling system, there are limited high-efficiency alternatives for data center cooling. In this study, we designed a reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) system that stores cooling energy during winters and produces it during summers for data center cooling. We then demonstrated the techno-economic performance of the RTES incorporated with dry coolers and heat recovery for a year-round 5 MW cooling load. The RTES cooling production was reliable during the 20-year lifetime. We estimated the levelized cost of cooling as \$5/MWh, significantly lower than \$15/MWh for the base scenario where chillers and dry coolers supply the same cooling load without the RTES. We also estimated that the RTES-based cooling system annually avoids CO2 emissions up to 1488 tCO2e compared to the base case. These results highlight techno-economic feasibility and environmental benefits of the RTES and its potential to be deployed for various applications at large scales as well as for data center cooling.},

In this work, we observe the significant role of correctly weighting the combination of multiple competitive loss functions for training PINNs effectively. To this end, we implement and evaluate different methods aiming at balancing the contributions of multiple terms of the PINN’s loss function and their gradients. After reviewing three existing loss scaling approaches (Learning Rate Annealing, GradNorm and SoftAdapt), we propose a novel self-adaptive loss balancing scheme for PINNs named ReLoBRaLo (Relative Loss Balancing with Random Lookback). We extensively evaluate the performance of the aforementioned balancing schemes by solving both forward as well as inverse problems on three benchmark PDEs for PINNs: Burgers’ equation, Kirchhoff’s plate bending equation, Helmholtz’s equation and over 20 PDEs from the ”PINNacle” collection. The results show that ReLoBRaLo is able to consistently outperform the baseline of existing scaling methods in terms of accuracy while also inducing significantly less computational overhead for a variety of PDE classes.},

Therein, the following five coupled nonlinear physical models are addressed: displacements (geo-mechanics), a phase-field variable to indicate the fracture position, a pressure equation (to describe flow), a proppant concentration equation, and/or a saturation equation for two-phase fracture flow, and finally a finite element crack width problem. The overall coupled problem is solved with a staggered solution approach, known in subsurface modeling as the fixed-stress iteration. A main focus is on physics-based discretizations. Galerkin finite elements are employed for the displacement-phase-field system and the crack width problem. Enriched Galerkin formulations are used for the pressure equation. Further enrichments using entropy-vanishing viscosity are employed for the proppant and/or saturation equations. A robust and efficient quasi-monolithic semi-smooth Newton solver, local mesh adaptivity, and parallel implementations allow for competitive timings in terms of the computational cost. Our framework can treat two- and three-dimensional realistic field and laboratory examples. The resulting program is an in-house code named IPACS (Integrated Phase-field Advanced Crack Propagation Simulator) and is based on the finite element library deal.II.

	abstract = {Efficient heat transfer from hot dry rock to a working fluid requires the large surface area provided by fractures. These fractures are likely to include both tensile hydraulic fractures and natural shear fractures and faults. Maintaining flow through these fractures is vital for the performance of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). Among numerous prior studies, there remains a lack of laboratory measurements to quantify shear fracture evolution in the coupled thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, and chemical (THMC) environment of a geothermal reservoir. To address this, we conducted triaxial direct-shear tests on crystalline, granitic rock samples from the Utah Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (Utah-FORGE) site in Milford, Utah. We measured fracture permeability, aperture, strength, deformation, and effluent chemistry before and after shear slip under in-situ conditions at the Utah-FORGE site – replicating stress, pressure, temperature, minerology, and injectate water chemistry. Our results show that shear displacement can increase fracture permeability by up to an order of magnitude (factor of ∼10); however, in some cases, permeability decreased by up to two orders of magnitude (factor of ∼0.01), due to gouge formation, chemical alteration, stress cycling, and changes in surface roughness. Our tests also indicate in-situ shear is likely to produce smooth-planar shear surfaces (e.g., dilation angles {\textless}7°), akin to slickensides, which reduces the benefit of shear fracture stimulation. Effluent analysis confirms rapid silicate and halite mineral dissolution and magnesium precipitation on FORGE samples, especially after shear stimulation. Our work provides key new measurements for modelling Utah-FORGE and similar granitic geothermal prospects.},

These research works have contributed to the development of the PFM from different perspectives, especially in connection with the mathematical formulations of the hydro-mechanical processes and the numerical algorithms to solve the emerging coupled problems. In this regard, the underlying paper aims to review the significant scientific works that utilized the PFM to model fracturing caused mainly by fluid injection in a certain porous domain and, less common, by fluid extraction (e.g., drying) from a certain porous domain. This includes reviewing different approaches for deriving the phase-field evolution formulation (e.g. Ginzburg–Landau approach, thermodynamically consistent approaches, and microforce-based approach) and reviewing several formulations for the stiffness degradation function and that of the crack driving force. Besides, the paper will go through several methods to estimate the crack aperture width, in addition to reviewing different numerical approaches and implementations. The paper will be concluded by presenting a number of open topics and challenges to be addressed in future works.},

	abstract = {Many geo-engineering applications, for example, enhanced geothermal systems, rely on hydraulic fracturing to enhance the permeability of natural formations and allow for sufficient fluid circulation. Over the past few decades, the phase-field method has grown in popularity as a valid approach to modeling hydraulic fracturing because of the ease of handling complex fracture propagation geometries. However, existing phase-field methods cannot appropriately capture nucleation of hydraulic fractures because their formulations are solely energy-based and do not explicitly take into account the strength of the material. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel phase-field formulation for hydraulic fracturing with the main goal of modeling fracture nucleation in porous media, for example, rocks. Built on the variational formulation of previous phase-field methods, the proposed model incorporates the material strength envelope for hydraulic fracture nucleation through two important steps: (i) an external driving force term, included in the damage evolution equation, that accounts for the material strength; (ii) a properly designed damage function that defines the fluid pressure contribution on the crack driving force. The comparison of numerical results for two-dimensional test cases with existing analytical solutions demonstrates that the proposed phase-field model can accurately model both nucleation and propagation of hydraulic fractures. Additionally, we present the simulation of hydraulic fracturing in a three-dimensional domain with various stress conditions to demonstrate the applicability of the method to realistic scenarios.},

	abstract = {The simulation of fluid-driven fracture propagation in a porous medium is a major computational challenge, with applications in geosciences and engineering. The two main families of modeling approaches are those models that represent fractures as explicit discontinuities and solve the moving boundary problem and those that represent fractures as thin damaged zones, solving a continuum problem throughout. The latter family includes the so-called phase field models. Continuum approaches to fracture face validation and verification challenges, in particular grid convergence, well posedness, and physical relevance in practical scenarios. Here we propose a new quasi-static phase field formulation. The approach fully couples fluid flow in the fracture with deformation and flow in the porous medium, discretizes flow in the fracture on a lower-dimension manifold, and employs the fluid flux between the fracture and the porous solid as coupling variable. We present a numerical assessment of the model by studying the propagation of a fracture in the quarter five-spot configuration. We study the interplay between injection flow rate and rock properties and elucidate fracture propagation patterns under the leak-off toughness dominated regime as a function of injection rate, initial fracture length, and poromechanical properties. For the considered injection scenario, we show that the final fracture length depends on the injection rate, and three distinct patterns are observed. We also rationalize the system response using dimensional analysis to collapse the model results. Finally, we propose some simplifications that alleviate the computational cost of the simulations without significant loss of accuracy.},

	abstract = {The well-known phase-field approach applied to fracturing solids has recently been embedded in the Theory of Porous Media for the description of hydraulic fracturing scenarios. This method has been found very convenient not only for the description of solid deformation and fracture but also for the transition of Darcy-type flow in the saturated porous-media domain towards Navier–Stokes-type flow in fractured zones. However, as a result of the monotonic evolution of the phase-field variable, the phase-field approach to fracture does not usually allow for the description of pre-existing closed fractures or of fractures closing after generation, where either only Darcy-type flow occurs or where Navier–Stokes-type flow turns back to Darcy-type flow. To tackle this issue, the present study concerns the introduction of a crack-opening indicator as an additional variable governed by the current deformation. By use of this procedure, not only opening but also closing fractures as well as pre-fractured domains can easily be included into the numerical simulation of fracking scenarios in saturated porous media. Proceeding from the finite-element analysis, the numerical results are found consistent with experimental observations presented in the literature.},

	abstract = {This study develops a hydro-damage-mechanical fully coupled numerical method capable of modelling complex fluid-driven transient dynamic crack propagation in quasi-brittle poroelastic media. In this method, the fluid flow in both fractures and porous media is described by a fluid continuity equation with the modified Darcy-Poiseuille law based on the Biot's poroelastic theory. The fluid pressure and the inertial force of solids are coupled by governing equations of the mesh-insensitive phase-field regularized cohesive zone model that can simulate quasi-brittle multi-crack initiation, propagation, branching and merging without remeshing or crack tracking. The resultant displacement-pressure-damage coupled multiphysics system of equations is solved using an alternative minimization Newton-Raphson iterative algorithm with an implicit Newmark integration scheme within the finite element framework. The new method was first validated by a few 2D problems, including crack branching and deflecting in solids, fracking in a concrete cube, and consolidation and stress wave propagation in poroelastic media, subjected to various impulsive loadings. It was then applied to pressure pulsing fracking of a 40 m granite rock reservoir with extensive parametric studies of fluid viscosity and pulsing injection rate, mode and period. It was found that pulsing injection with higher fluid rates and lower fluid viscosities resulted in more developed crack patterns, and in particular, there existed an optimal pulsing injection period that could promote fracking under relatively low injection pressures. 3D horizontal well problems with multiple non-planar crack propagation and bifurcation were also successfully simulated to demonstrate the capacity and potential of the new method for engineering design and optimization of pressure pulsing fracking.},

SRM samples containing thousands of non-persistent joints can be submitted to standard laboratory tests (UCS, triaxial loading, and direct tension tests) or tested under a non-trivial stress path representative of the stresses induced during the engineering activity under study. Output from the SRM methodology includes pre-peak properties (modulus, damage threshold, peak strength, etc.) and post-peak properties (brittleness, dilation angle, residual strength, fragmentation, etc.). Of particular interest is the ability to obtain predictions of rock mass scale effects, anisotropy, and brittleness, properties that cannot be obtained using empirical methods of property estimation.

	abstract = {As carbon storage technologies advance globally, methods to understand and mitigate induced earthquakes become increasingly important. Although the physical processes that relate increased subsurface pore pressure changes to induced earthquakes have long been known, reliable methods to forecast and control induced seismic sequences remain elusive. Suggested reservoir engineering scenarios for mitigating induced earthquakes typically involve modulation of the injection rate. Some operators have implemented periodic shutdowns (i.e., effective cycling of injection rates) to allow reservoir pressures to equilibrate (e.g., Paradox Valley) or shut‐in wells after the occurrence of an event of concern (e.g., Basel, Switzerland). Other proposed scenarios include altering injection rates, actively managing pressures through coproduction of fluids, and preinjection brine extraction. In this work, we use 3D physics‐based earthquake simulations to understand the effects of different injection scenarios on induced earthquake rates, maximum event magnitudes, and postinjection seismicity. For comparability, the modeled injection considers the same cumulative volume over the project’s operational life but varies the schedule and rates of fluid injected. Simulation results show that cyclic injection leads to more frequent and larger events than constant injection. Furthermore, with intermittent injection scenario, a significant number of events are shown to occur during pauses in injection, and the seismicity rate remains elevated for longer into the postinjection phase compared to the constant injection scenario.},

	abstract = {Seismic hazard forecasts of induced seismicity often require estimates of the maximum possible magnitude (Mmax). Empirical models suggest that maximum magnitudes, or expected number of earthquakes, are related to the volume of injected fluid. We perform a suite of 3D physics-based earthquake simulations with rate- and state-dependent friction, systematically varying the area of the pressurized region and the amplitude of the initial homogeneous or heterogeneous shear stress. Using the resulting catalog we explore the conditions that result in pressure-controlled versus runaway ruptures that extend outside the pressurized zone. We find that proposed empirical scaling laws correctly predict Mmax when shear stresses are further from failure (≤90\% of maximum shear stress) and for high amplitude stress fields. Runaway ruptures are observed for higher initial shear stresses and smoother stress fields. In these cases, runaway ruptures occur early after the onset of injection and rarely preceded by foreshock activity.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic operations involving underground fluid extraction or injection can cause unexpectedly large and even damaging earthquakes, despite operational and regulatory efforts. In this Review, we explore the physical mechanisms of induced seismicity and their fundamental applications to modelling, forecasting, monitoring and mitigating induced earthquakes. The primary mechanisms of injection-induced earthquakes considered important for creating stress perturbations include pore-pressure diffusion, poroelastic coupling, thermoelastic stresses, earthquake interactions and aseismic slip. Extraction-induced earthquakes are triggered by differential compaction linked with poroelastic effects and reservoir creep. Secondary mechanisms include reducing the rock mass strength subject to stress corrosion, dynamic weakening and cohesion loss. However, constraining the maximum magnitude, Mmax, of a potential earthquake on the basis of physical process understanding is still challenging. Common Mmax theories are based on injection volume as the single source of strain, which might not be efficient in seismically active regions. Alternative time-based Mmax models have the potential to explain why some induced earthquake events tap into tectonic strain and lead to runaway ruptures (in which the rupture front extends beyond the perturbed rock volume). Developments in physics-based forecasting and potential future success in mitigation of induced-seismic risk could help increase the acceptance of emerging energy technologies such as enhanced geothermal systems and underground gas storage during the sustainable transition.},

	abstract = {Induced seismicity associated with fluid injection has raised serious concerns for the safety and efficiency of geo-energy systems. Cyclic injection has recently been proposed as an alternative injection scheme to reduce the large magnitude injection-induced seismicity. However, the influence of cyclic injection on the activation of natural fractures in granite and the resulting seismic risk is not yet clear. This study investigates the injection-induced activation of a critically stressed natural fracture in a granite core sample, particularly focusing on the comparison between monotonic and cyclic water injection under pressure-controlled and volume-controlled conditions. Experimental results show that the acceleration and deceleration of fracture slip are modulated by the shear stress imbalance between the fixed shear stress and the evolving frictional strength of the fracture. Fracture slip affects the fluid pressure distribution on the fracture, which in turn regulates the frictional strength of the fracture. At a small total shear displacement (i.e., {\textasciitilde} 0.9 mm in this study), cyclic injection with a restricted peak injection pressure results in aseismic fracture slip at much smaller peak slip rates compared to that during the monotonic injection. On the one hand, the more uniform reduction in effective normal stress caused by cyclic injection encourages slow and stable fracture slip, characterized by the smaller peak slip rates. On the other hand, the flowback of injected fluid or suspension of injection could prevent the occurrence of fast-accelerated fracture slip during cyclic injection. However, the fracture can become unstable when it has experienced a considerable amount of total shear displacement (larger than {\textasciitilde} 0.9 mm in this study), and likely gained a significantly enhanced permeability. Continued injection after the unstable shut-in stage, signified by an unusual increase in slip rate and an accelerated drop in injection pressure, could result in rapid and unstable fracture slip.},

	abstract = {Acoustic emissions recorded during slow heating of rocks at 1 atm have generally been attributed to intergranular stresses generated by differences in thermal expansion coefficients and elastic moduli of neighboring grains. These experiments have considered only the solid phases in analysis of the results, and little attention has been given to the role of intragranular or grain boundary fluid inclusions in initiating or facilitating fracturing. In principle, fluid inclusions may be thought of as a special case in which the “ neighboring grains” are fluids rather than the usual solid mineral phases. The major differences are that (1) the number of inclusions per unit volume is usually 102 to 106 times greater than the number of mineral grains in that same volume and that (2) the volume increase with temperature for most fluids is 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than for minerals. Thus, when fluid inclusion “grains” are considered, the absolute number of grain-to-grain contacts in a given sample volume is several orders of magnitude greater than if the inclusions are not considered. Further, the magnitude of the stresses between any two adjacent grains may be much higher if one of the “grains” is a fluid inclusion, owing to the larger coefficient of thermal expansion of the fluid relative to a solid phase. As a result, substantial overpressures may be generated at the fluid inclusion “grain”-mineral grain contact, during heating experiments. These overpressures result in brittle failure when the stress around the inclusion exceeds the local strength of the host crystal. In fluid inclusion terminology, this fracturing event is referred to as decrepitation. Samples of Westerly granite and Sioux quartzite were heated at 2° C/min in a gas-flow stage in order to determine the decrepitation profiles (number of decrepitations as a function of temperature) of these rocks. Decrepitation was monitored visually during heating experiments, and was evidenced by the explosive loss of fluids from the inclusion during a fracturing event. Decrepitation produces microfractures which originate at decrepitated fluid inclusions and propagate outward into the surrounding mineral. Four different types of inclusions, based on room temperature phase ratios and distribution within the host phase, were noted in Westerly granite. Type (1) inclusions contain a single aqueous liquid, type (2) are two-phase, liquid-rich inclusions, type (3) are mostly one-phase fluid inclusions that occur in dense clusters in plagioclase and type (4) are two-phase, moderate-density, H2O-CO2-“salt” inclusions. Type (5) inclusions are one-phase, aqueous liquid inclusions observed in Sioux quartzite. Fluid inclusions in Westerly granite decrepitate between 75° and 573° C with peaks at 275–300°C and 400–450°C. Type (4) inclusions in Westerly granite tend to decrepitate at lower temperatures (75–300°C) than other inclusion types. Initial fracturing of the quartz host surrounding type (1) inclusions (primary decrepitation) generally occurs over the range 100–400°C and the fractures continue to propogate through the quartz (secondary decrepitation) during further heating from 400° to 573°C. Fluid inclusions in Sioux quartzite decrepitate between 188° and 573°C with a broad maximum at 250–450°C. Primary decrepitation generally occurs at 200–450°C while secondary decrepitation occurs at 350°–573°C in Sioux quartzite. Some small inclusions in both samples do not decrepitate until the quartz α-β transition temperature (573°C) is reached. Decrepitation profiles determined in this study display many similarities and differences when compared to previously published acoustic emission profiles of Westerly granite and Sioux quartzite. Owing to fundamental differences in the techniques used to measure acoustic emission and decrepitation, and the potentially different energies associated with the two events, it is unclear whether decrepitating fluid inclusions are recorded during acoustic emission studies. However, if decrepitating fluid inclusions are being recorded during acoustic emission measurements, then our results suggest that: (1) decrepitation contributes more to low temperature portions of acoustic emission profiles than to high temperature portions for both Sioux quartzite and Westerly granite; (2) compared to Westerly granite, a larger percentage of acoustic emissions in the low temperature decrepitation profile of Sioux quartzite is due to fluid inclusions; (3) decrepitating fluid inclusions, not stresses generated by solid-solid interactions, cause the majority of intragranular fracturing in quartz below the temperature of the α-β transition in both these rocks.},

	abstract = {I made measurements of the permanent strain of thermal expansion, compressional wave velocity, and density of microcracks of Inada granite, which was subjected to slow and homogeneous temperature change under atmospheric pressure. The permanent strain implying the cumulative amount of newly generated microcracks and the opening of preexisting microcracks appeared distinctly at a temperature between 100° and 125°C and increased almost exponentially in the range from 200°C to immediately before the temperature of α-β transition in quartz (573°C) as the peak temperature of the thermal cycle was elevated. At 600°C, the strain increased further. The density of the microcracks was heightened as the peak temperature increased. Moreover, the said trend coincided with that of the crack density parameter estimated from the compressional wave velocity. At the same time, the maximum width of the microcracks, which was determined by microscopic observation, and the average width increment of the microcracks, calculated from the permanent strain and microcrack density, showed a similar trend. Using the mercury intrusion porosimetry method, the average width increment of the microcracks coincided with the equivalent width of the microcracks measured. There are two causes of thermally induced microcracking: the mismatching of the coefficients of thermal expansion between the adjacent mineral grains and the decrepitation of the fluid inclusions. The density of the fluid inclusion microcracks showed a remarkable increase starting from the peak temperature of 300°C. At temperatures equal to or higher than 400°C, the fluid inclusion microcracks accounted for approximately 35\% of all the intragranular cracks.},

	abstract = {Fluid inclusions break, or decrepitate, when the fluid pressure exceeds the least principal lithostatic stress by a critical amount. After decrepitation, excess fluid pressure is relaxed, resulting in crack arrest; subsequently, crack healing may occur. Existing models of decrepitation do not adequately explain several experimentally observed phenomena. We developed a linear elastic fracture mechanics model to analyze new data on decrepitation and crack arrest in San Carlos olivine, compared the model with previous fluid inclusion investigations, and used it to interpret some natural decrepitation microstructures. The common experimental observation that smaller inclusions may sustain higher internal fluid pressures without decrepitating may be rationalized by assuming that flaws associated with the inclusion scale with the inclusion size. According to the model, the length of the crack formed by decrepitation depends on the lithostatic pressure at the initiation of cracking, the initial sizes of the flaw and the inclusion, and the critical stress intensity factor. Further experiments show that microcracks in San Carlos olivine heal within several days at 1280 to 1400°C; healing rates depend on the crack geometry, temperature, and chemistry of the buffering gas. The regression distance of the crack tip during healing can be related to time through a power law with exponent n = 0.6. Chemical changes which become apparent after extremely long heat-treatments significantly affect the healing rates. Many of the inclusions in the San Carlos xenoliths stretched, decrepitated, and finally healed during uplift. The crack arrest model indicates that completely healed cracks had an initial fluid pressure of the order of 1 GPa. Using the crack arrest model and the healing kinetics, we estimate the ascent rate of these xenoliths to be between 0.001 and 0.1 m/s.},

	abstract = {Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) have the potential to make a significant contribution to the world energy inventory. One controversial issue associated with EGS, however, is the impact of induced seismicity or microseismicity, which has been the cause of delays and threatened cancellation of at least two EGS projects worldwide. Although microseismicity has in fact had few (or no) adverse physical effects on operations or on surrounding communities, there remains public concern over the amount and magnitude of the seismicity associated with current and future EGS operations. The primary objectives of this paper are to present an up-to-date review of what is already known about the seismicity induced during the creation and operation of EGS, and of the gaps in our knowledge that, once addressed, should lead to an improved understanding of the mechanisms generating the events. Several case histories also illustrate a number of technical and public acceptance issues. We conclude that EGS-induced seismicity need not pose a threat to the development of geothermal energy resources if site selection is carried out properly, community issues are handled adequately and operators understand the underlying mechanisms causing the events. Induced seismicity could indeed prove beneficial, in that it can be used to monitor the effectiveness of EGS operations and shed light on geothermal reservoir processes.},

	abstract = {Geothermal energy is a viable alternative to gas for the heating of buildings, industrial areas and greenhouses, and can thus play an important role in making the transition to sustainable energy in the Netherlands. Heat is currently produced from the Dutch subsurface through circulation of water between two wells in deep (1.5–3 km) geothermal formations with temperature of up to ∼100 °C. As the number of these so-called doublets is expected to increase significantly over the next decades, and targeted depths and temperatures increase, it is important to assess potential show-stoppers related to geothermal operations. One of these potential hazards is the possibility of the occurrence of felt seismic events, which could potentially damage infrastructure and housing, and affect public support. Such events have been observed in several geothermal systems in other countries. Here we review the occurrence (or the lack) of felt seismic events in geothermal systems worldwide and identify key factors influencing the occurrence and magnitude of these events. Based on this review, we project the findings for seismicity in geothermal systems to typical geothermal formations and future geothermal developments in the Netherlands. The case study review shows that doublets that circulate fluids through relatively shallow, porous, sedimentary aquifers far from the crystalline basement are unlikely to generate felt seismic events. On the other hand, stimulations or circulations in or near competent, fractured, basement rocks and production and reinjection operations in high-temperature geothermal fields are more prone to induce felt events, occasionally with magnitudes of M {\textgreater} 5.0. Many of these operations are situated in tectonically active areas, and stress and temperature changes may be large. The presence of large, optimally oriented and critically stressed faults increases the potential for induced seismicity. The insights from the case study review suggest that the potential for the occurrence of M {\textgreater} 2.0 seismicity for geothermal operations in several of the sandstone target formations in the Netherlands is low, especially if faults can be avoided. The potential for induced seismicity may be moderate for operations in faulted carbonate rocks. Induced seismicity always remains a complex and site-specific process with large unknowns, and can never be excluded entirely. However, assessing the potential for inducing felt seismic events can be improved by considering the relevant (site-specific) geological and operational key factors discussed in this article.},

In this work, the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm is used in the development of a multiphase flow model for submarine landslides. The underwater landslide and the ambient water are simulated using the non-Newtonian and Newtonian fluid models, respectively. An artificial diffusion term of density is incorporated in the governing equation, and the equation of state is modified to improve the stability and accuracy of the SPH model. Three benchmark problems are simulated using the SPH model. The effect of SPH particle size on the simulated results is also explored. The effects of the rheological parameters on the landslide motion behavior are investigated by conducting a sensitivity analysis. Numerical results fit the experimental data well, indicating the good stability of the SPH model and its accuracy in simulating the motion and impact behavior of submarine landslides.},

While Eulerian methods already benefit extensively from AI, notably in reliable weather prediction, the application of AI to Lagrangian methods remains less consolidated. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a Lagrangian mesh-less numerical method for CFD with well-established advantages for the simulation of highly dynamic free-surface flows. Here, we explore an application of AI to SPH simulations, utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate hydrodynamic forces between particle pairs, learning from SPH-simulated results. A model of this nature, which emulates the mathematical representation of physics, is termed an emulator . We examine the physical significance of the emulator, presenting its applications in benchmark tests, assessing its faithfulness to traditional SPH simulations, and highlighting its ability to generalize and simulate test cases with varying levels of complexity beyond its training data.},

In the NPM, PINN is applied to globally approximate field variables, and the high-order Implicit Runge–Kutta (IRK) method is used to treat the time integration. The NPM can easily achieve incompressibility and deal with the free-surface problem. However, the NPM is currently limited to inviscid hydrodynamics problems and is computationally expensive. In this work, we developed a general NPM (gNPM) for viscous hydrodynamics modeling. In the gNPM, a single pressure is output as the predicted pressure field rather than the multiple pressures in the original NPM. Thus, the size of the neural network is greatly reduced, making the gNPM computationally more efficient. Besides, the spatial derivatives in the governing equations are calculated with respect to the current spatial coordinates rather than the predicted space. In this manner, the gNPM is more straightforward to be implemented. Furthermore, by considering the viscous term in the conservation of momentum, the gNPM can be applied for viscous hydrodynamics modeling. The effectiveness and robustness of the gNPM have been demonstrated through several hydrodynamics benchmark cases with different boundary conditions. We highlight that the proposed gNPM is able to cope with highly uneven particle distributions, while the traditional meshfree method can produce severe failure.},

SPH is a class of Lagrangian schemes that discretize fluid dynamics via finite material points that are tracked through the evolving velocity field. Due to the particle-like nature of the simulation, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as appealing and successful surrogates. However, the practical utility of such GNN-based simulators relies on their ability to faithfully model physics, providing accurate and stable predictions over long time horizons - which is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we identify particle clustering originating from tensile instabilities as one of the primary pitfalls. Based on these insights, we enhance both training and rollout inference of state-of-the-art GNN-based simulators with varying components from standard SPH solvers, including pressure, viscous, and external force components. All Neural SPH-enhanced simulators achieve better performance than the baseline GNNs, often by orders of magnitude in terms of rollout error, allowing for significantly longer rollouts and significantly better physics modeling.

This manuscript approaches this problem by developing a hierarchy of parameterized reduced Lagrangian models for turbulent flows, and investigates the effects of enforcing physical structure through Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) versus relying on neural networks (NN)s as universal function approximators. Starting from Neural Network (NN) parameterizations of a Lagrangian acceleration operator, this hierarchy of models gradually incorporates a weakly compressible and parameterized SPH framework, which enforces physical symmetries, such as Galilean, rotational and translational invariances. Within this hierarchy, two new parameterized smoothing kernels are developed in order to increase the flexibility of the learn-able SPH simulators. For each model we experiment with different loss functions which are minimized using gradient based optimization, where efficient computations of gradients are obtained by using Automatic Differentiation (AD) and Sensitivity Analysis (SA). Each model within the hierarchy is trained on two data sets associated with weekly compressible Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT): (1) a validation set using weakly compressible SPH; and (2) a high fidelity set from Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). Numerical evidence shows that encoding more SPH structure improves generalizability to different turbulent Mach numbers and time shifts, and that including the novel parameterized smoothing kernels improves the accuracy of SPH at the resolved scales.},

We find that previously used learning approaches are significantly outperformed by methods that integrate the solver into the training loop and thereby allow the model to interact with the PDE during training. This provides the model with realistic input distributions that take previous corrections into account, yielding improvements in accuracy with stable rollouts of several hundred recurrent evaluation steps and surpassing even tailored supervised variants.

Simulation at lower-resolution on a coarse-grid introduces significant errors. We introduce a machine learning (ML) technique based on a deep neural network architecture that corrects the numerical errors induced by a coarse-grid simulation of turbulent flows at high-Reynolds numbers, while simultaneously recovering an estimate of the high-resolution fields. Our proposed simulation strategy is a hybrid ML-PDE solver that is capable of obtaining a meaningful high-resolution solution trajectory while solving the system PDE at a lower resolution. The approach has the potential to dramatically reduce the expense of turbulent flow simulations. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate our ML-PDE strategy on a two-dimensional turbulent (Rayleigh Number \$Ra=10{\textasciicircum}9\$) Rayleigh-B{\textbackslash}'enard Convection (RBC) problem.},

This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10× finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches.

Powerful tools for tasks that have been traditionally complex to automate have been developed, such as image synthesis and natural language processing. In the context of simulating fluid dynamics, this has led to a series of novel DL methods for replacing or augmenting conventional numerical solvers. We broadly classify these methods into physics- and data-driven methods. Physics-driven methods, generally, tune a DL model to provide an analytical and differentiable solution to a given fluid dynamics problem by minimizing the residuals of the governing partial differential equations. Data-driven methods provide a fast and approximate solution to any fluid dynamics problem that shares some physical properties with the observations used when tuning the DL model’s parameters. Meanwhile, the symbiosis of numerical solvers and DL has led to promising results in turbulence modelling and accelerating iterative solvers. However, these methods present some challenges. Exclusively data-driven flow simulators often suffer from poor extrapolation, error accumulation in time-dependent simulations, as well as difficulties in training against turbulent flows.

	abstract = {Numerical prediction of coastal inundation can be complex due to the multiple physical processes involved and typically requires two-dimensional numerical model extents, particularly in areas with complex along-shore morphology. Such model domains often incur relatively high computational expense. Recent extreme inundation studies for Wellington, New Zealand, were executed using the numerical tool, XBeach. Here, the two-dimensional physical dynamics associated with multiple small embayments and both reef and sandy beach substrates, require large, high spatial resolution numerical model extents, informed by a multi-source elevation surface. XBGPU, is a translation of key XBeach features into code that permits GPU-based acceleration. The present study presents a comparison between XBeach and XBGPU for the same numerical model configuration and extents. Three model resolutions were employed, ranging from a typical desktop CPU based XBeach model resolution, to the highest resolution model that will require High Performance Computing (HPC) scale resources. Two CPU HPC facilities were used and five GPUs to investigate the scalability of both XBeach and XBGPU. The latter ranged from desktop grade units to GPUs associated with professional computing facilities. XBeach scalability is investigated by mean of the speed-up ratio, the time saving ratio and the computational efficiency. These are in reference to the computational speed of a model running on one CPU core. The XBGPU speed-up ratio is presented as a function of the slowest GPU. Direct comparisons between XBeach and XBGPU were achieved by using computational capacity as a metric. The results indicate that even a desktop grade GPU can compete with the computational efficiency of HPC-scale CPU facilities. Small model resolutions presented inefficient scaling on both high-performance CPUs and GPUs while the high-resolution model presented near linear scalability for the high-performance GPUs. Nevertheless, HPCs can be efficient to solve large computational problems if enough CPUs are employed.},

	abstract = {The accurate prediction of a barrier island response to storms is challenging because of the complex interaction between hydro- and morphodynamic processes that changes at different stages during an event. Assessment of the predictive skill is further complicated because of uncertainty in the hydraulic forcing, initial conditions, and the parameterization of processes. To evaluate these uncertainties, we investigated the morphological change that occurred during two Atlantic hurricane events on two barrier islands at Matanzas (Florida) and Fire Island (New York) with differing topographies and forcing conditions. We used the morphodynamic model XBeach with hydrodynamic forcing extracted from a regional coupled D-Flow FM/SWAN model. The XBeach model was initialized with a spatially varying roughness map derived from a land cover classification map generated with supervised conditional-random-field classification. The model was supplemented with a dynamic roughness module recognizing that, under extreme conditions, vegetation can be washed away or buried by sediment. For the Fire Island case, the modeled spatial extent of roughness reduction as a proxy for vegetation removal during the storm was accurate. For both the Fire Island and Matanzas cases, the model predicted erosion and deposition volumes and dune-crest lowering well. The occurrence of breach formation was also predicted by the model, but the exact location of these breaches did not match observations. Variations of 10\% in boundary conditions (surge, wave direction, significant wave height, and bay water levels) produced regime shifts in modeled barrier island response. These results not only stress the critical role of boundary conditions in morphodynamic model skill, but also show the limitations of single deterministic model runs in forecasting impact.},

	abstract = {Accurate information about nearshore waves and sediment transport is essential for designing and operating many coastal projects, such as wetland restoration, flood protection, port and harbor development, and coastal zone management. However, in-situ measurements are usually spatially and temporally sparse and time-consuming to achieve. Thus, various models have been developed to simulate nearshore waves and sediment transport, such as physics-based and machine learning models. For physics-based models, there has been considerable progress in predicting nearshore waves and sediment transport by solving the action balance equation, momentum balance equation, and advection-diffusion equation with the finite difference, finite element, or spectral methods during the past three decades. Considering the sensitivity of meshing a complicated geometry and the difficulty of creating nested computational domains, high-fidelity physics-based models can be computationally prohibitive for many real-world complex applications. Recently, the development of machine learning theory, computer hardware, and remote sensing technologies have created new opportunities for using soft computing-based models to explore nearshore wave fields and morphological changes. In this work, we develop four types of models to simulate/reconstruct wave fields and investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of sediment transport in shallow waters. The objective is five-fold: (1) to simulate wave fields and sediment transport in a connected river-estuary-ocean system with physics-based models, (2) to estimate wave parameters with data-driven models in an estuary, (3) to simulate nearshore waves with hybrid methods by combining physics-based and data-driven models and identify sources of error in physics-based models, (4) to reconstruct wave fields with physics-informed machine learning models, and (5) to solve the surf zone bathymetric inversion problem with physics-informed neural networks. Firstly, a coupled flow-wave Delft3D model was developed to study hydrodynamics and sediment transport in Fourleague Bay of the Mississippi River Delta and explore effective strategies for designing and implementing sediment diversions for wetland restoration and coastal resilience to sea level rise. We found that the riverine sediment tended to be directly deposited in the marshes when the river discharge was high with strong northerly winds at the study site. During calm weather, the riverine sediment was more likely to be deposited into the bay floor first, which was later resuspended and transported to the marshes during storms. It is therefore important to retain sediments from river divisions in shallow bays and allow storms to redistribute them to adjacent wetlands in a deltaic environment.Secondly, we developed soft computing-based models to estimate long-term wind wave characteristics across a living shoreline project with constructed oyster reefs (CORs) in Delaware Bay based on short-term field measurements during storms. This enabled us to determine the wave power variation across the living shorelines on a yearly basis. It was found that when the CORs were emergent or slightly submerged, the averaged wave height attenuation was about 39.8\% from the offshore gauge to the nearshore gauge (behind CORs) during 2018–2020, owing to the combined effect of nearshore bathymetric changes and CORs. This study provides a novel framework to predict long-term wave characteristics based on short-term wave measurements using machine learning models.Thirdly, we integrated the physics-based model with machine learning models to estimate wave parameters in a shallow estuary in the Mississippi River Delta and identified the main factors causing simulation errors in physics-based wave models. The results show that the wind direction and bottom friction coefficient were the main factors causing errors in the physics-based modeled significant wave height and peak wave period, respectively. We showed that the developed hybrid approach could be an efficient tool for modelers to identify sources of error and calibrate parameters in physics-based models. Fourthly, a novel PINN (physics-informed neural network) model was developed to reconstruct wave fields in shallow waters with scarce wave measurements by combining prior knowledge into the soft-computing learning algorithm. The model performance is examined by comparing the PINN outputs with numerical solutions from a physics-based model and experimental data over a two-dimensional alongshore uniform barred beach and a three-dimensional circular shoal, respectively. Our results show that the physics-guided deep learning method is a promising tool for studying nearshore processes.Fifthly, we developed an inverse PINN model to determine the nearshore bathymetry based on remote sensing or in-situ data. The results showed that PINNs could well estimate both the bathymetry and wave fields with a much smaller amount of training data than pure ANN models. Moreover, we found that the effect of wave nonlinearity (i.e., amplitude dispersion) on depth inversion and wave field prediction can be incorporated into the models, which is one of the advantages of using PINNs to solve bathymetry inversion problems. Overall, our results show that the inverse PINN model is a promising tool for estimating nearshore water depth based on observations from various sensing platforms.},

In combination, the proposed method allows us to increase the physical accuracy of the learned simulator substantially. In addition, the induced physical bias leads to significantly better generalization performance and makes our method more reliable in unseen test cases. We evaluate our method on a range of different, challenging fluid scenarios. Among others, we demonstrate that our approach generalizes to new scenarios with up to one million particles. Our results show that the proposed algorithm can learn complex dynamics while outperforming existing approaches in generalization and training performance.

In this study, the applicability and suitability of the XBeach numerical model for modelling earth dam failures driven by overtopping with water is explored by detailed comparison with controlled experimental data. The XBeach model is applied to simulate laboratory-scale breaches caused by overtopping failure of dams constructed with uniform sand at the Queen's University Landslide Flume by Walsh et al. (2021a). The model sensitivity to boundary conditions for different virtual flume sizes, different sediment transport equations that influence erosion rates, and the process of avalanching are investigated. The model results are in best agreement with laboratory measurements when the Soulsby-van Rijn sediment transport formulation is used, which depends on grain size, and the avalanching module is activated, indicating the importance of these processes. The model is also run for different dam geometries to investigate the influence of upstream slope angle, which is relevant for tailings dam breach analyses. The results indicate that for flatter slopes the model is in closer agreement with observations of the peak discharge, while for steeper slopes the model results are better for breach duration time. Overall, XBeach provides promising results for the prediction of the dam breach outflow hydrograph at the laboratory scale and has potential to improve understanding of earth dam failure outcomes with further investigation.},

The goals of this study are to gain a better understanding of the physical processes that govern breach behavior and to assess whether process-based models can be used to forecast the evolution of future breaches. The wilderness breach grew rapidly in size during the first winter following formation. Growth of the breach was accompanied by the formation of a complex of flood shoals inside Great South Bay, a primary channel that flowed through the eastern part of the flood shoals, and an ebb shoal on the ocean side of the breach. From the summer of 2013 through late 2015, the breach continued to change and evolve, albeit at a much slower pace than in the first year after formation. A hybrid combination of Delft3D and XBeach models is used to hindcast the morphodynamic evolution of the wilderness breach over the first three years after formation. The formation of the breach during Hurricane Sandy is not part of the simulations. Model simulations are initiated with a post-storm topography in which the breach is already present. The models are capable of hindcasting the main morphodynamic changes of the wilderness breach. The spatial patterns, as well as the bulk statistics, such as breach geometry and sediment volume changes, are reasonably well reproduced by the model. The model sheds light on previously unknown processes of breach evolution, especially regarding sediment transport and flow regimes within the breach complex.},

	title = {Morphodynamics and sand transport on perched beaches},
	abstract = {[Truncated abstract] Beach morphology results from the complex interactions between sediments and nearshore hydrodynamics. In many locations these interactions are influenced by reef and rock outcrops along the beach profile. These hard landforms form structural constraints in the nearshore that result in perched beaches, defined as beaches that are underlain and/or fronted seaward by hard landforms. Beaches along the Yanchep coastline in south-western Australia are perched on Quaternary limestone reefs. Sand transport at Yanchep Lagoon varies over a range of temporal scales and is strongly a ected by interactions with the topographically complex reefs. To better understand how perched beaches are a ected by waves, water level and the topography of reefs, this study investigated processes that in uence hydrodynamics and sand transport on perched beaches at a range of scales extending from the ocean basin; the continental shelf; the beach and at the reef scale. A suite of numerical models, complemented by eld data, were con gured and applied to cover a range of spatial and temporal scales. To include these scales, four different models were used: (1) Wave Watch III was used to hindcast waves from 1970 to 2009 in the southern Indian Ocean basin; (2) SWAN was used to evaluate the dissipation of waves on the continental shelf; (3) XBeach GPU was developed to simulate the wave dissipation, the hydrodynamics and the transport of sand at the beach scale; and, (4) Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model was used at ne scale to simulate the wave breaking on a steep reef and the transport of individual sand grains. The mean signi cant wave heights, at the basin scale, indicated that between 1970 and 2009, the number of large wave events incident along the Western Australian coastline did not change signi cantly despite the increasing number of large wave events in the Southern Indian Ocean. The mean latitude of large wave events was negatively correlated to the Southern Annular Mode. Therefore, the Southern Annular Mode modulates the inter annual variability of the wave heights but the swell generated from the increasing number of storms in the Southern Ocean contributed to increasing the mean annual wave height o shore of Western Australia.},

	abstract = {National weather forecasting agencies routinely issue a range of hazard warnings. But to our knowledge, along sandy coastlines where storm waves and storm surge can result in widespread but location-specific beach erosion and beachfront flooding, no national-scale early warning service for these hazards is presently operational. This paper outlines the scientific basis and implementation of a new framework for large area coastal storm hazards forecasting, currently being tested along the southwest (Indian Ocean) and southeast (Pacific Ocean) coasts of Australia. The system provides 7-day rolling predictions of localized beach erosion and/or coastal flooding linked to forecasted extreme weather events. Coastal setting influences the nature and occurrence of these hazards, with sandy beaches along wave-dominated coasts more prone to erosion and at surge-dominated coasts to flooding. An existing nearshore water-level forecasting system and a new inshore wave modeling capability are used to forecast beach erosion and coastal flooding at every 100 m along the shore. At the regional scale O(100–1 000 km of coastline), a threshold-based decision tree model categorises the predicted extent, location, and severity of erosion and flooding. At a more local scale O(100–1 000 m), physics-based modeling using XBeach focuses on vulnerable or high-value locations, providing specific storm hazard indicators tailored to local needs. This two-tier approach is feasible for national implementation due to the reduced computational effort, limiting intensive modeling to pre-identified critical locations. Delft-FEWS manages the data and modeling workflow, ensuring scalability and compatibility with existing forecast infrastructure.

In this context, models that forecast the morphological evolution of coastal areas can be used to anticipate the effects of future scenarios, allowing early action to mitigate the damage caused by extreme events. Hence, this study included data from three different monitoring programs in data models to simulate the seasonal morphological evolution of several Portuguese beaches. Two different data models were implemented using the Random Forest algorithm. One was fed with profile data and wave conditions while the other considered also sediment size data. Both models achieved suitable performances, but the inclusion of sediment data reduced the model errors and variance, and thus improved model performance. It was demonstrated that combining data from multidisciplinary campaigns can be a solution to generate reliable and robust morphological forecasting models.},

For the present machine-learning-based data reconstruction, we use the downsampled skip-connection/multiscale model based on a convolutional neural network, incorporating the multiscale nature of fluid flows into its network structure. As an initial example, the model is applied to the two-dimensional cylinder wake at 𝑅𝑒𝐷=100ReD=100Re\_D = 100. The reconstructed flow fields by the present method show great agreement with the reference data obtained by direct numerical simulation. Next, we apply the current model to a two-dimensional decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The machine-learned model is able to track the decaying evolution from spatial and temporal coarse input data. The proposed concept is further applied to a complex turbulent channel flow over a three-dimensional domain at 𝑅𝑒𝜏=180Reτ=180Re\_\{{\textbackslash}tau \}=180. The present model reconstructs high-resolved turbulent flows from very coarse input data in space, and also reproduces the temporal evolution for appropriately chosen time interval. The dependence on the number of training snapshots and duration between the first and last frames based on a temporal two-point correlation coefficient are also assessed to reveal the capability and robustness of spatio-temporal super resolution reconstruction. These results suggest that the present method can perform a range of flow reconstructions in support of computational and experimental efforts.},

The CNN and DSC/MS models are found to reconstruct turbulent flows from extremely coarse flow field images with remarkable accuracy.

	abstract = {When choosing an appropriate hydrodynamic model, there is always a compromise between accuracy and computational cost, with high-fidelity models being more expensive than low-fidelity ones. However, when assessing uncertainty, we can use a multifidelity approach to take advantage of the accuracy of high-fidelity models and the computational efficiency of low-fidelity models. Here, we apply the multilevel multifidelity Monte Carlo method (MLMF) to quantify uncertainty by computing statistical estimators of key output variables with respect to uncertain input data, using the high-fidelity hydrodynamic model XBeach and the lower-fidelity coastal flooding model SFINCS (Super-Fast INundation of CoastS). The multilevel aspect opens up the further advantageous possibility of applying each of these models at multiple resolutions. This work represents the first application of MLMF in the coastal zone and one of its first applications in any field. For both idealised and real-world test cases, MLMF can significantly reduce computational cost for the same accuracy compared to both the standard Monte Carlo method and to a multilevel approach utilising only a single model (the multilevel Monte Carlo method). In particular, here we demonstrate using the case of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, USA, that this improvement in computational efficiency allows for in-depth uncertainty analysis to be conducted in the case of real-world coastal environments – a task that would previously have been practically unfeasible. Moreover, for the first time, we show how an inverse transform sampling technique can be used to accurately estimate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of variables from the MLMF outputs. MLMF-based estimates of the expectations and the CDFs of the variables of interest are of significant value to decision makers when assessing uncertainty in predictions.},

Numerical models can predict beach response to storms with fidelity, but their computational costs, the domain-specific knowledge necessary to use them, and the wide range of potential future storm and beach conditions can hinder their use in forecasting storm erosion for short- and long-term horizons. We develop an emulator, which is an efficient predictive model that behaves like a numerical model, to predict the morphologic response of the subaerial beach to storms. Specific emphasis is placed on providing antecedent beach states as an input to the emulator and predicting the post-storm profile shape. Training data include beach profiles at multiple stages in a nourishment life cycle to assess if such a framework can be applied in locations that nourish as a coastal defense policy. Development and application of the emulator is focused on Nags Head, North Carolina, which nourishes its beaches to mitigate hazards of storm waves, flooding, and erosion. A high-fidelity, process-based morphodynamic model is used to train the emulator with 1250 scenarios of sea-storms and beach profiles. The post-storm beach state is emulated with a parameterized power-law function fit to the eroded portion of the subaerial profile. When the emulator was tested for a sequence of real storms from 2019, the eroded beach profiles were predicted with a skill score of 0.66. This emulator is promising for future efforts to predict storm-induced beach erosion in hazard warnings or adaptation studies.},

	abstract = {Dune erosion is an important aspect to consider when assessing coastal flood risk, as dune elevation loss makes the protected areas more susceptible to flooding. However, most advanced dune erosion numerical models are computationally expensive, which hinders their application in early-warning systems. Based on a combination of probabilistic and process-based numerical modeling, we develop an efficient statistical tool to predict dune erosion during storms. The analysis focuses on Dauphin Island, AL, in the northern Gulf of Mexico, where we combine synthetic sea storms with a calibrated and validated XBeach model to develop and test a range of different surrogate models for their ability to predict barrier island geometric parameters under storm conditions. Surrogate models are developed by combining the oceanographic forcing from 100 optimally sampled sea storm events covering the entire multivariate parameter space (used as XBeach input) and associated changes in the dune system (XBeach output). We test four surrogate models using a k-fold approach for validation. All models perform well in predicting changes in dune elevation, barrier island area, and width but are less accurate in predicting alterations in the cross-shore locations of dune morphological features. Multivariate adaptive regression splines is identified as the best surrogate model based on its fast development and good performance, attaining a modified Mielke index of 0.81 for dune crest height. As demonstrated at Dauphin Island, our approach shows potential to be used in an operational framework to predict dune response (in particular crest elevation change) when water level and wave forecasts are available.},

	abstract = {A framework is introduced that leverages known physics to reduce overfitting in machine learning for scientific applications. The partial differential equation (PDE) that expresses the physics is augmented with a neural network that uses available data to learn a description of the corresponding unknown or unrepresented physics. Training within this combined system corrects for missing, unknown, or erroneously represented physics, including discretization errors associated with the PDE's numerical solution. For optimization of the network within the PDE, an adjoint PDE is solved to provide high-dimensional gradients, and a stochastic adjoint method (SAM) further accelerates training. The approach is demonstrated for large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulence. High-fidelity direct numerical simulations (DNS) of decaying isotropic turbulence provide the training data used to learn sub-filter-scale closures for the filtered Navier–Stokes equations. Out-of-sample comparisons show that the deep learning PDE method outperforms widely-used models, even for filter sizes so large that they become qualitatively incorrect. It also significantly outperforms the same neural network when a priori trained based on simple data mismatch, not accounting for the full PDE. Measures of discretization errors, which are well-known to be consequential in LES, point to the importance of the unified training formulation's design, which without modification corrects for them. For comparable accuracy, simulation runtime is significantly reduced. A relaxation of the typical discrete enforcement of the divergence-free constraint in the solver is also successful, instead allowing the DPM to approximately enforce incompressibility physics. Since the training loss function is not restricted to correspond directly to the closure to be learned, training can incorporate diverse data, including experimental data.},

	abstract = {Most state-of-the-art approaches for weather and climate modeling are based on physics-informed numerical models of the atmosphere. These approaches aim to model the non-linear dynamics and complex interactions between multiple variables, which are challenging to approximate. Additionally, many such numerical models are computationally intensive, especially when modeling the atmospheric phenomenon at a fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning instead aim to directly solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack the generality of numerical models. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatio-temporal coverage, and physical groundings. ClimaX extends the Transformer architecture with novel encoding and aggregation blocks that allow effective use of available compute while maintaining general utility. ClimaX is pre-trained with a self-supervised learning objective on climate datasets derived from CMIP6. The pre-trained ClimaX can then be fine-tuned to address a breadth of climate and weather tasks, including those that involve atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales unseen during pretraining. Compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that this generality in ClimaX results in superior performance on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections, even when pretrained at lower resolutions and compute budgets.

	abstract = {We present a hybrid surf-zone model that combines numerical simulations and statistical/machine learning techniques, enabling accurate calculations of nearshore wave and hydrodynamic parameters with high computational efficiency. The approach involves defining representative forcing conditions, carrying out numerical model (XBeach) simulations for these cases, and training machine learning models capable of predicting selected model output variables. Data decomposition via Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis further simplifies the process, reducing the output data dimensionality, with minimal accuracy loss (with exception of certain wetting-drying processes). Three machine learning approaches of increasing complexity are compared: a multi-variate linear regression (LR), a Radial Basis Functions (RBF) interpolator and a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The LR model fails to account for the complex non-linearities in coastal wave dynamics, which warrants the use of more complex machine learning techniques. Both the RBF interpolator and the DNN models demonstrate high levels of accuracy in the prediction of short wave heights, mean wavelength, and depth-averaged currents, with slightly lower accuracy for long (infragravity) wave heights and fraction of breaking waves. The proposed surrogate model thus offers an efficient alternative to computationally expensive numerical model simulations, enabling rapid and reliable long-period deterministic simulations (multi-decadal hindcasts) and/or multi-ensemble probabilistic scenario simulations of nearshore hydrodynamic conditions. We provide a comprehensive description of the implementation details and assess the surrogate model's performance in representing various wave and hydrodynamic parameters. We discuss potential use cases and limitations, noting that this hybrid modeling technique can be adapted for use with other numerical models in various settings.},

The CMS was designed and developed for coastal inlets and navigation applications, including channel performance and sediment exchange between inlets and adjacent beaches. The present report provides an updated description of the mathematical formulations and numerical methods of hydrodynamic, salinity and sediment transport, and morphology change model CMS-Flow. The CMS-Flow uses the Finite Volume Method on Cartesian grids and has both fully explicit and fully implicit time stepping schemes. A detailed description of the explicit time stepping scheme was provided in Militello et al. 2004 and Buttolph et al. 2006. The present report focuses on the recent changes in the mathematical formulations, and the implicit time stepping schemes. The CMS-Wave and CMS-Flow models are tightly coupled within a single inline code. The CMS-Wave and CMS-Flow grids may be the same or have different spatial extents and resolutions. The hydrodynamic model includes physical processes such as advection, turbulent mixing, combined wave-current bottom friction wave mass flux wind, atmospheric pressure, wave, river, and tidal forcing Coriolis force and the influence of coastal structures. The implicit hydrodynamic model is coupled to a nonequilibrium transport model of multiple-sized total-load sediments. The model includes physical processes such as hiding and exposure, bed sorting and gradation, bed slope effects, nonerodible surfaces, and avalanching.},

Both Duck94 and NSTS Santa Barbara data were used for evaluating Delft3D performance. Many parameters and options including roller, breaker delay, and breaking dissipation formulations are evaluated.

Driven by larger-scale models of meteorology and hydrodynamics, these models simulate morphodynamics across the Sallenger storm-impact scale, including swash,collision, overwash, and inundation. Models are becoming both wider (as more processes are added) and deeper (as detailed physics replaces earlier parameterizations). Algorithms for wave-induced flows and sediment transport under shoaling waves are among the recent developments. Community and open-source models have become the norm. Observations of initial conditions (topography, land cover, and sediment characteristics) have become more detailed, and improvements in tropical cyclone and wave models provide forcing (winds, waves, surge, and upland flow) that is better resolved and more accurate, yielding commensurate improvements in model skill. We foresee that future storm-impact models will increasingly resolve individual waves, apply data assimilation, and be used in ensemble modeling modes to predict uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Solving the shallow water equations efficiently is critical to the study of natural hazards induced by tsunami and storm surge, since it provides more response time in an early warning system and allows more runs to be done for probabilistic assessment where thousands of runs may be required. Using adaptive mesh refinement speeds up the process by greatly reducing computational demands while accelerating the code using the graphics processing unit (GPU) does so through using faster hardware. Combining both, we present an efficient CUDA implementation of GeoClaw, an open source Godunov-type high-resolution finite volume numerical scheme on adaptive grids for shallow water system with varying topography. The use of adaptive mesh refinement and spherical coordinates allows modeling transoceanic tsunami simulation. Numerical experiments on the 2011 Japan tsunami and a local tsunami triggered by a hypothetical Mw 7.3 earthquake on the Seattle Fault illustrate the correctness and efficiency of the code, which implements a simplified dimensionally split version of the algorithms. Both numerical simulations are conducted on subregions on a sphere with adaptive grids that adequately resolve the propagating waves. The implementation is shown to be accurate and faster than the original when using Central Processing Units (CPUs) alone. The GPU implementation, when running on a single GPU, is observed to be 3.6 to 6.4 times faster than the original model running in parallel on a 16-core CPU. Three metrics are proposed to evaluate relative performance of the model, which shows efficient usage of hardware resources.},

The depth-averaged shallow water equations can be used to reduce this to a time-dependent problem in two space dimensions, but even so it is crucial to use adaptive mesh refinement in order to efficiently handle the vast differences in spatial scales. This must be done in a ‘wellbalanced’ manner that accurately captures very small perturbations to the steady state of the ocean at rest. Inundation can be modelled by allowing cells to dynamically change from dry to wet, but this must also be done carefully near refinement boundaries. We discuss these issues in the context of Riemann-solver-based finite volume methods for tsunami modelling. Several examples are presented using the GeoClaw software, and sample codes are available to accompany the paper. The techniques discussed also apply to a variety of other geophysical flows.},

A leading technique for solving large-scale PDEs is using multigrid methods. At the core of a multigrid solver is the prolongation matrix, which relates between different scales of the problem. This matrix is strongly problem-dependent, and its optimal construction is critical to the efficiency of the solver. In practice, however, devising multigrid algorithms for new problems often poses formidable challenges. In this paper we propose a framework for learning multigrid solvers. Our method learns a (single) mapping from a family of parameterized PDEs to prolongation operators. We train a neural network once for the entire class of PDEs, using an efficient and unsupervised loss function. Experiments on a broad class of 2D diffusion problems demonstrate improved convergence rates compared to the widely used Black-Box multigrid scheme, suggesting that our method successfully learned rules for constructing prolongation matrices.},

	abstract = {Efficient numerical solvers for partial differential equations empower science and engineering. One commonly employed numerical solver is the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm, whose performance is largely affected by the preconditioner quality. However, designing high-performing preconditioner with traditional numerical methods is highly non-trivial, often requiring problem-specific knowledge and meticulous matrix operations. We present a new method that leverages learning-based approach to obtain an approximate matrix factorization to the system matrix to be used as a preconditioner in the context of PCG solvers. Our high-level intuition comes from the shared property between preconditioners and network-based PDE solvers that excels at obtaining approximate solutions at a low computational cost. Such observation motivates us to represent preconditioners as graph neural networks (GNNs). In addition, we propose a new loss function that rewrites traditional preconditioner metrics to incorporate inductive bias from PDE data distributions, enabling effective training of high-performing preconditioners. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our proposed approach on solving various 2D and 3D linear second-order PDEs.},

Here we use a random forest to learn a parameterization from coarse-grained output of a three-dimensional high-resolution idealized atmospheric model. The parameterization leads to stable simulations at coarse resolution that replicate the climate of the high-resolution simulation. Retraining for different coarse-graining factors shows the parameterization performs best at smaller horizontal grid spacings. Our results yield insights into parameterization performance across length scales, and they also demonstrate the potential for learning parameterizations from global high-resolution simulations that are now emerging.},

Some investigations suggest that a priori-trained ML models exhibit satisfying accuracy during training but poor performance when coupled to dynamical cores and tested. Here we use the evolution of the barotropic vorticity equation (BVE) with periodically reinforced shear instability as a prototype problem to develop and evaluate a model-consistent training strategy, which employs a numerical solver supporting automatic differentiation and includes the solver in the loss function for training ML-based subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence models. This approach enables the interaction between the dynamical core and the ML-based parameterization during the model training phase. The BVE model was run at low, high, and ultrahigh (truth) resolutions. Our training dataset contains only a short period of coarsened high-resolution simulations. However, given initial conditions long after the training dataset time, the trained SGS model can still significantly increase the effective lead time of the BVE model running at the low resolution by up to 50\% relative to the BVE simulation without an SGS model. We also tested using a covariance matrix to normalize the loss function and found it can notably boost the performance of the ML parameterization. The SGS model’s performance is further improved by conducting transfer learning using a limited number of discontinuous observations, increasing the forecast lead-time improvement to 73\%. This study demonstrates a potential pathway to using machine learning to enhance the prediction skills of our climate and weather models. Significance Statement Numerical weather prediction is performed at limited resolution for computational feasibility, and the schemes to estimate unresolved processes are called parameterization. We propose a strategy to develop better deep learning–based parameterization in which an automatic differentiable numerical solver is employed as the dynamic core and interacts with the parameterization scheme during its training. Such a numerical solver enables consistent deep learning, because the parameterization is trained with a direct target of making the numerical model (dynamic core and parameterization together) forecast match observations as much as possible. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of such a strategy using a surrogate model and advocate that such machine learning–enabled numerical models provide a promising pathway to developing next-generation weather forecast and climate models.},

	abstract = {Recently, a growing number of studies have used machine learning (ML) models to parameterize computationally intensive subgrid-scale processes in ocean models. Such studies typically train ML models with filtered and coarse-grained high-resolution data and evaluate their predictive performance offline, before implementing them in a coarse resolution model and assessing their online performance. In this work, we systematically benchmark the online performance of such models, their generalization to domains not encountered during training, and their sensitivity to data set design choices. We apply this proposed framework to compare a large number of physical and neural network (NN)-based parameterizations. We find that the choice of filtering and coarse-graining operator is particularly critical and this choice should be guided by the application. We also show that all of our physics-constrained NNs are stable and perform well when implemented online, but generalize poorly to new regimes. To improve generalization and also interpretability, we propose a novel equation-discovery approach combining linear regression and genetic programming with spatial derivatives. We find this approach performs on par with neural networks on the training domain but generalizes better beyond it. We release code and data to reproduce our results and provide the research community with easy-to-use resources to develop and evaluate additional parameterizations.},

	abstract = {The representation of nonlinear subgrid processes, especially clouds, has been a major source of uncertainty in climate models for decades. Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that data-driven Earth system model development could play a key role in reducing climate prediction uncertainty in the coming decade.},

While the CFD approach can capture the multidimensional behavior of CTH phenomena, its computational cost is high when modeling complex accident scenarios. To mitigate this expense, we propose reliance on coarse-grid CFD (CG-CFD). Coarsening the computational grid increases the grid-induced error thus requiring a novel approach that will produce a surrogate model predicting the distribution of the CG-CFD local error and correcting the fluid-flow variables. Given sufficiently fine-mesh simulations, a surrogate model can be trained to predict the CG-CFD local errors as a function of the coarse-grid local flow features. The surrogate model is constructed using Machine Learning (ML) regression algorithms. Two of the widely used ML regression algorithms were tested: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF). The proposed CG-CFD method is illustrated with a three-dimensional turbulent flow inside a lid-driven cavity. We studied a set of scenarios to investigate the capability of the surrogate model to interpolate and extrapolate outside the training data range. The proposed method has proven capable of correcting the coarse-grid results and obtaining reasonable predictions for new cases (of different Reynolds number, different grid sizes, or larger geometries). Based on the investigated cases, we found this novel method maximizes the benefit of the available data and shows potential for a good predictive capability.},

Here, we adopt a computationally cost-effective approach based on the Non-Intrusive Polynomial Chaos Expansion method to quantify the sensitivity of XBeach to its input parameters. The method is applied to the coastal erosion event caused by Hurricane Sandy along the barrier islands of New Jersey in the United States. The results show a spatial variation of the model sensitivity with increasing boundary conditions. Parameters’ interaction is found to decrease as the magnitude of boundary conditions increases, causing a reduction in the nonlinearity of the model behavior, and consequently leading to a reduction in the uncertainty of the model output.},

	abstract = {Hydromorphodynamic modelling has as one of its pillars the speed of obtaining results. Sometimes it is only due to the necessity to finish some work or to make other simulations but for example when talking about operational systems, this problematic takes even more strength. If other coastal operational modelling have to be coupled after, the model itself has to be fed by other models or the results have to be published periodically, the importance of the simulation speed is clear. A problem appears because there is an insoluble paradigm which doesn't allow to make simulations combining the best approaches for this three variables: low "computational time", high "resolution" and huge "study area". For example, if we want to simulate a huge coastal area but we need to present the results as soon as possible (i.e. low computational time), we will not be able to use a high-resolution grid because it will fail in the second statement. This problem appears in all the other possible scenarios involving this three variables where the best response for all of them cannot be satisfied at the same time due to the paradigm. Then, since it is impossible to totally solve this problematic, a lot of efforts have been made to reduce its effects and to work with the best possible approaches. In this work, two methodologies that try to improve the performance of the hydromorphodynamic simulations with XBeach model are tested and statically compared with the typical performance. On one hand, a direct reduction of the computational time using parallel computing, specifically Message Passing Interface (MPI) with Cluster application. On the other hand, the conversion of the grids that are used for the simulation from rectangular to curvilinear in order to increase only the resolution of the area of interest in the grid, maintaining lower resolutions for the rest of the area.This research received funding from INTERREG EFA 344/19 MARLIT Project European Union / European Regional Development Fund thanks (FEDER) and was done with the support from the Secretariat for Universities and Research of the Ministry of Business and Knowledge of the Government of Catalonia and the European Social Fund.

Concerning multiphase ﬂow computations, an advantage of the Lagrangian SPH over Eulerian approaches is that the advection step is straightforward. Consequently, the interphasial surface can be explicitly determined from the positions of particles representing different phases; therefore, there is no need for the interface reconstruction step. In this review paper, we brieﬂy recall the basics of the SPH approach, and in particular the physical modelling and numerical implementation issues. We also mention the weaknesses of the approach and some remedies to overcome them. Then, we demonstrate the applicability of SPH to selected interfacial ﬂow cases, including the liquid column break-up, gas–liquid ﬂow regimes in a channel capturing the transitions between them and the wetting phenomena. Concerning the two-ﬂuid modelling, it is illustrated with sediment transport in the presence of surface waves. Various other applications are brieﬂy recalled from the rich and growing literature on the subject, followed by a tentative list of challenges in multiphase SPH.},

	abstract = {Multiphase flow and reactive transport are two essential physicochemical processes that govern the effectiveness of geological carbon sequestration (GCS). The interaction and feedback among different phases and components during intricate physicochemical processes hold great significance in understanding CO2 sequestration. Pore-scale simulations can account for multiphase flow and reactive transport processes in porous media and obtain spatial distributions of parameters (density, velocity, concentration, etc.) in the pore space as well as their temporal evolutions. This proves especially valuable considering that experiments can be hindered by constraints in spatial and temporal resolution. The comprehensive insights garnered from pore-scale research can be leveraged for continuum modeling using the representative elementary volume (REV) concept. In this contribution, four sequential mechanisms of CO2-brine-rock interaction in three zones delineated by CO2 saturation are elaborated to elucidate complicated physicochemical processes involved in GCS, which are followed by general descriptions of mathematical equations and pore-scale numerical methods. In addition, as interested and commonly encountered processes, leakage risks during GCS and CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) processes are presented. The existing challenges and future directions are discussed for both the performance of the pore-scale models and the current gaps in the field of GCS. We expect that this review will prove beneficial for researchers interested in pore-scale simulations, GCS, and related disciplines.},

	abstract = {Surface tension plays a crucial role in determining the interfacial behavior between partially miscible fluid systems, and affects the overall dynamics of phase transition processes. Accurate modeling of surface tension is crucial for understanding and predicting various phase transition phenomena, such as capillary-driven flows, droplet formation, and interfacial dynamics. Cubic equations of state (EoS), such as the van der Waals (vdW) model, incorporate two corrective terms to account for intermolecular interactions. These terms improve the predictions of the equation of state at high pressures and low temperatures, where intermolecular forces become significant; however they also affect to the effective surface tension when the EoS is used in combination with diffuse-interface models of multiphase systems. The ability to capture the correct surface tension is essential in pore-scale models flow through permeable media, particularly in capillary-dominated flow regimes. For typical geological or industrial pore sizes the effective surface tension obtained using standard equations of state may be several orders of magnitude larger than the physical value, which greatly affects the accuracy and physical fidelity of the simulations. In this work we present a methodology that allows diffuse-interface numerical methods to reproduce the physical surface tension in pore-scale simulations of multiphase flow. The proposed methodology is applied to the simulation of interfacial processes at arbitrary length scales while honoring the physical surface tension driving capillary phenomena.},

	abstract = {When fluid flows in porous media under subsurface conditions, significant deformation can occur. Such deformation is dependent on structural and phase characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the effect of multiphase flow on the deformation of porous media at the pore scale by implementing a strongly coupled partitioned solver discretized with finite volume (FV) technique. Specifically, the role of capillary forces on grain deformation in porous media is investigated. The fluid and solid subdomains are meshed using unstructured independent grids. The model is applied for solving multiphase coupled equations and is capable of capturing pore scale physics during primary drainage by solving the Navier-Stokes equation and advecting fluid indicator function using volume of fluid (VOF) while the fluid is interacting with a nonlinear elastic solid matrix. The convergence of the coupled solver is accelerated by Aitken underrelaxation. We also reproduce geomechanical stress conditions, at the pore scale, by applying uniaxial stress on the solid while simultaneously solving the multiphase fluid-solid interaction problem to investigate the effect of external stress on fluid occupancy, velocity-field distribution, and relative permeability. We observe that the solid matrix exhibits elasto-capillary behavior during the drainage sequence. Relative permeability endpoints are shifted on the basis of the external stress exerted.},

Such exchanges, thus, are very important when different fluids, under the influence of external forces, coexist in the pore space. In this work, the response of Berea sandstone under quasi-static loading conditions is modeled in the presence of multiple fluid phases. The solid matrix is characterized by hyperelasticity, while the fluids are assumed to be incompressible and Newtonian. The behavior of the sample was investigated during the exertion of confining stresses at the grain boundaries followed by a sequence of drainage and imbibition cycles, using the Volume of fluid (VOF) method, to investigate the effect of triaxial loading on fluid distribution. We further investigated the role of stress on relative permeability, initial water saturation, residual oil saturation and trapped oil globule size distribution. Our results indicate relative permeability alteration due to compaction and changes in the pore geometry. Relative permeability of the oil phase during drainage was reduced, while there was a slight decrease in relative permeability of water. Furthermore, the initial water saturation increased due to a general shift in the pore/throat diameter distribution towards smaller values leading to the wetting phase occupying more pore throats. Finally, higher confining stress conditions resulted in a greater distribution of disconnected oil globules compared to a smaller distribution of globules at zero stress conditions.},

	abstract = {In the subsurface, fluids play a critical role by transporting dissolved minerals, colloids, and contaminants (sometimes over long distances); by mediating dissolution and precipitation processes; and by enabling chemical transformations in solution and at mineral surfaces. Although the complex geometries of fracture apertures, fracture networks, and pore spaces may make it difficult to accurately predict fluid flow in saturated (single-phase) subsurface systems, well-developed methods are available. The simulation of multiphase fluid flow in the subsurface is much more challenging because of the large density and/or viscosity ratios found in important applications (water/air in the vadose zone; water/oil, water/gas, gas/oil, and water/oil/gas in hydrocarbon reservoirs; water/air/nonaqueous phase liquids (nonaqueous phase liquids/dense nonaqueous phase liquids) in contaminated vadose zone systems; and gas/molten rock in volcanic systems, for example). In addition, the complex behavior of fluid-fluid-solid contact lines and their impact on dynamic contact angles must also be taken into account and coupled with the fluid flow. Here we review the methods that are currently being used to simulate pore-scale multiphase fluid flow and reactive transport in fractured and porous media. After the introduction, the review begins with an overview of the fundamental physics of multiphase fluids flow followed by a more detailed discussion of the complex dynamic behavior of contact lines and contact angles, an important barrier to accurate pore-scale modeling and simulation. The main part of the review focuses on five different approaches: pore network models, lattice gas and lattice Boltzmann methods, Monte Carlo methods, particle methods (molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and traditional grid-based computational fluid dynamics coupled with interface tracking and a contact angle model. Finally, the review closes with a discussion of future trends and challenges.},

	abstract = {Multiphase flow modeling through porous media, especially in the oil and gas industry, involves numerically solving differential equations. Several phenomena such as chemical, physical, mechanical, and geological must be considered to solve these equations, and there is no analytical solution for this method. The characterization of these phenomena is possible through laboratory experiments that cannot cover a wide range of parameters and operational conditions. In this study, we investigated the practical use of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method for modeling the multiphase flow through the porous media with complex and random geometry. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of using SPH as a complementary method alongside laboratory studies. First, characterization of the single-phase flow was performed, and the essential macroscopic parameters like absolute permeability tensor and tortuosity were extracted. Then, the two-phase flow modeling through porous media was studied. These studies show that the practical parameters such as local saturation changes, fluid displacement, flow hysteresis, breakthrough time, average flow velocity, relative permeability curve, Buckley–Leverett theory, capillary desaturation curve, and recovery factor could be obtained. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the multiphase flow through the non-uniform porous media was done. For this purpose, the effect of three parameters (geometry of the porous medium, viscosity ratio, and wettability) on multiphase flow through the porous medium was investigated. It was shown that wettability is the most influential parameter in light-phase recovery. At the next level, the geometry of the porous medium shows the most significant effect on the production rate, and the lowest effect was related to the viscosity ratio. The results of this study show that the SPH method can provide a suitable view to the reservoir engineers to predict the multiphase flow behavior through the porous media.},

The Smagorinsky model is employed to implement turbulence stress. Two validation tests were performed to verify the effectiveness of the ISPH technique, the first evaluating pressure over still water in a tank, the second RTI in free fluid, and excellent agreement was obtained in both tests. The results indicate that porosity parameters play a crucial role in controlling the RTI phenomenon and mixing in the sloshing tank. Low porosity leads to high porous resistance, which significantly reduces RTI development and the mixing processes between the two fluids by hindering the interaction of the heavier and lighter fluids.

In contrast to time-consuming and often expensive laboratory tests, pore scale-resolved numerical simulations further enable the computational quantification of anisotropy of inherent material properties and the estimation of representative sample domains. Numerically calculated quantities are valuable in several fields, such as carbon dioxide sequestration, geothermal energy production and groundwater contamination remediation. Our specific pore scale-resolved simulation method directly based on images obtained from Micro X-Ray Computed Tomography (μXRCT) is based on the weakly compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach. SPH is a meshless Lagrangian method, highly suitable for modeling complex geometries and flow at moderate Reynolds numbers. Low Reynolds number flow, also denoted as creeping flow, is a typical scenario present in the above mentioned applications. However, SPH is computationally demanding, especially in simulations of large domains. To overcome these difficulties, we have designed a specific SPH module for the highly optimized HOOMD-blue Molecular Dynamics software. Our implementation supports single-phase flow, and targets both CPU and GPU clusters. Due to the high computational demands, scalability is essential to make the software practically usable, and our tests indicate that our implementation can scale almost ideally. We study a wide variety of test cases, which are not only representative for XRCT-based geometries, but for pore scale-resolved flow simulations in general. Additionally, we present a large-scale simulation investigating an unconventional high porous volcanic rock sample (Reticulite).

	abstract = {We present our new multiscale pairwise-force smoothed particle hydrodynamics (PF-SPH) model for the characterization of flow in fractured porous media. The fully coupled multiscale PF-SPH model is able to simulate flow dynamics in a porous and permeable matrix and in adjacent fractures. Porous medium flow is governed by the volume-effective Richards equation, while the flow in fractures is governed by the Navier-Stokes equation. Flow from a fracture to the porous matrix is modeled by an efficient particle removal algorithm and a virtual water redistribution formulation to enforce mass and momentum conservation. The model is validated by (1) comparison to a finite-element model (FEM) COMSOL for Richards-based flow dynamics in a partially saturated medium and (2) laboratory experiments to cover more complex cases of free-surface flow dynamics and imbibition into the porous matrix. For the laboratory experiments, Seeberger sandstone is used because of its well-known homogeneous pore space properties. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of the permeable matrix is estimated from a pore size and grain size distribution analysis. The developed PF-SPH model shows good correlation with the COMSOL model and all types of laboratory experiments. We employ the proposed model to study preferential flow dynamics for different infiltration rates. Here, flow in the fracture is associated with the term “preferential flow,” providing rapid water transmission, while flow within the adjacent porous matrix enables only slow and diffuse water transmission. Depending on the infiltration rate and water inlet location, two cases can be distinguished: (1) immediate preferential/fracture flow or (2) delayed preferential flow. In the latter case, water accumulates at the surface first (ponding), then the fracture rapidly transmits water to the bottom system outlet. For the immediate fracture flow response, ponding only occurs once the fracture is fully saturated with water. In all cases, preferential flow is much more rapid than diffuse flow even under saturated porous medium conditions. Furthermore, infiltration dynamics in rough fractures adjacent to an impermeable or permeable matrix for different infiltration rates are studied as well. The simulation results show a significant lag in arrival times for small infiltration rates when a permeable porous matrix is employed, rather than an impermeable one. For higher infiltration rates, water rapidly flows through the fracture to the system outlet without any significant delay in arrival times even in the presence of the permeable matrix. The analysis of the amount of water stored in permeable fracture walls and in a fracture void space shows that for small infiltration rates, most of the injected water is retarded within the porous matrix. Flow velocity is higher for large infiltration rates, such that most of the water flows rapidly to the bottom of the fracture with very little influence of matrix imbibition processes.},

The change of absolute permeability and porosity during compaction is found follow a power-law relation. The stress-dependent absolute permeability in homogeneous pack is in agreement with the prediction of Carman-Kozeny equation. Porosity exponent is increased due to the existence of vugs but is decreased with fractures. Relative permeability, on the other hand, is found not only affected by pore structure of compacted media, but also properties of fluids and rock surface. Our simulations indicate that relative permeability of wetting phase increases slightly with increasing stress, due to the formation of more continuous pathways. Relative permeability of non-wetting phase, however, either increases or decreases depending on viscosity ratio and capillary number. It is found that lubrication effects play an important role in the stress sensitivity of relative permeability.},

	abstract = {Reservoir deformations due to stress changes may have a substantial impact on the effective flow properties of reservoir rocks, which may potentially impact productivity and injectivity performance. Absolute permeability has been a primary factor in measuring hydraulic conductivity of porous materials. In order to investigate the impact of the granular structure and the extent of intergranular cementation on stress-dependent absolute permeability, we present a workflow that utilizes limited knowledge about the rock sample in the form of micro-Computed Tomography images to simulate stress-induced deformations. This analysis is then followed by Lattice Boltzmann Methods to simulate fluid flow in the deformed medium. While previous works using digital rocks ignored the impact of intergranular cements, we should consider the impact of these cements on the stress sensitivity of absolute permeability of the rock. It is notable that changes in the rock properties like the nature of stress would be a continuous change, so measurements at few stress points may not be enough to describe the overall response in any arbitrary loadings. Despite empirical formulae that are limited to few measurements, we proposed a method based on the equation of states to estimate rock permeability through three independent strain invariants. Digital rock physics, finite element analysis, and Lattice Boltzmann Methods were integrated to obtain a quick estimation of the rock permeability using micro-CT images without the need for repetitive laboratory experiments. Our results show that absolute permeability decreases significantly with increasing first and third strain invariants while it slightly increases with the second strain invariant. The stress sensitivity of absolute permeability was found to be negatively correlated with Young’s modulus of the intergranular cement. We observed that incorporating more intergranular cement will make the absolute permeability more sensitive to stress changes.},

The stability and numerical accuracy of the SPH-based model was verified by comparing its results with analytical results and finite element numerical solutions. The numerical stability of the model was also verified by performing simulations with different time steps and different number of particles (different resolutions). The model was used to study the effects of the Damkohler and Peclet numbers and pore-scale heterogeneity on reactive transport and the character of mineral precipitation and to estimate effective reaction coefficients and mass transfer coefficients. Depending on the combination of Damkohler and Peclet numbers the precipitation may be uniform throughout the porous domain or concentrated mainly at the boundaries where the solute is injected and along preferential flow paths. The effective reaction rate coefficient and mass transfer coefficient exhibited hysteretic behavior during the precipitation process as a result of changing pore geometry and solute distribution. The changes in porosity and fluid fluxes resulting from mineral precipitation were also investigated. It was found that the reduction in the fluid flux increases with increasing Damkohler number for any particular reduction in the porosity. The simulation results show that the SPH, Lagrangian particle method is an effective tool for studying pore-scale flow and transport. The particle nature of SPH models allows complex physical processes such as diffusion, reaction, and mineral precipitation to be modeled with relative ease.},

Key aspects of our method are implicit elastic forces and an adapted SPH formulation for the deformation gradient that—in contrast to previous work—allows a rotation extraction directly from the SPH deformation gradient. The proposed implicit concept is entirely based on linear formulations. As a linear strain tensor is used, a rotation-aware computation of the deformation gradient is required. In contrast to existing work, the respective rotation estimation is entirely realized within the SPH concept using a novel formulation with incorporated kernel gradient correction for first-order consistency. The proposed implicit formulation and the adapted rotation estimation allow for significantly larger time steps and higher stiffness compared to explicit forms. Performance gain factors of up to one hundred are presented. Incompressibility of deformable solids is accounted for with an ISPH pressure solver. This further allows for a pressure-based boundary handling and a unified processing of deformables interacting with SPH fluids and rigids. Self-collisions are implicitly handled by the pressure solver.},

At smaller scales, surface tension and friction between fluids and the boundary play an essential role and are even able to counteract gravitational forces. There are quite a few existing approaches that model surface tension forces within an SPH environment. However, as often as not, physical correctness and simulation stability are still major concerns with many surface tension formulations. We propose a new approach to compute surface tension that is both robust and produces the right amount of surface tension.Conversely, less attention was given to friction forces at the fluid-boundary interface. Recent experimental research indicates that Coulomb friction can be used to describe the behavior of droplets resting on a slope. Motivated by this, we develop a novel friction force formulation at the fluid-boundary interface following the Coulomb model, which allows us to replicate a new range of well known fluid behavior such as the motion of rain droplets on a window pane.Both forces are combined with an IISPH variant into one unified solver that is able to simultaneously compute strongly coupled surface tension, friction and pressure forces.},

Instead of updating the entire simulation domain, we only update the regions near the solid boundary that are affected by the deformation. To update the SDF, we develop a grid node search algorithm based on dynamic triangular patches to obtain node change values. Furthermore, we propose a neighbor grid node update method based on triangular vertex movement to calculate increments of volume maps, quantifying the changes in solid shape. We further demonstrate that our approach is suitable for GPU parallel computing, and handles diversiform scenarios, even including solid fracture simulation mesh or aberrant deformation rectification.},

The model rigorously solves for the fluid pressure fields, incorporates detailed descriptions of pore-scale fluid interface dynamics, and explicitly accounts for flow through wetting layers. This modeling platform further benefits from heavy parallelization and advanced domain decomposition techniques to achieve computational efficiency. We first build an equivalent pore network of a rough-walled Berea sandstone fracture using its high-resolution x-ray images. Next, to validate the dynamic model, primary drainage and imbibition simulations are conducted with fluid properties and boundary conditions matching their experimental counterparts. We show that the predicted two-phase fluid occupancy maps for both displacement processes agree well with those observed experimentally using x-ray computed tomography. Afterward, a comprehensive simulation study of flow patterns and capillary trapping during imbibition is performed under varying flow conditions, fluid properties, and initial saturations. The generated results provide significantly improved insights into the effects of wettability, gravity and viscous forces, and initial non-wetting (NW) phase saturation on the morphology and size distribution of the trapped NW phase clusters and the final residual NW phase saturation. By revealing the interplay among the capillary, buoyancy, and viscous forces, our results create a guideline on how the removal of NW phase from fractured media can be influenced by adjusting the operational settings. These findings have broad implications for predictions of capillary trapping behavior in fractured media.},

The fluid–fluid immiscible displacement patterns range from viscous to capillary fingering to compact displacement owing to the competition between capillary and viscous forces. Although has been profoundly studied for porous media, the phase diagram of displacement patterns as well as the displacement efficiency was rarely reported for rough fractures. Here we studied immiscible displacements in a horizontal transparent rough fracture under a wide range of capillary number Ca and viscosity ratio M. We performed drainage experiments of water-glycerol mixture displacing silicone oil to visualize the displacement processes under favorable conditions (1 ≤ log10M ≤ 3). Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of the dynamic invasion morphologies, we for the first time proposed a full phase diagram for rough fracture, showing the domains of pattern formations (viscous fingering, capillary fingering and compact displacement) and the corresponding displacement efficiency as a function of Ca and M. The phase diagram indicates that the displacement efficiency decreases with the increase of Ca in the domain of compact-displacement. We can show that this efficiency reduction is attributed to the onset of localized flow channel induced by the spatial variability of fracture aperture. In this zone, the front is stable at initial stage until approaching a critical location, after which a finger is initiated and advances toward the outlet along the center of the fracture void space with much higher velocity, demonstrating the important role of the heterogeneity of fracture geometry in the displacement processes. This study not only extends the phase diagram from porous media to rough fractures but also improves our understanding of the dynamics of displacement processes jointly governed by the viscous/capillary forces and the fracture geometry under favorable conditions.},

Numerous previous works experimentally investigated the dynamics of multiphase flow in fractures, but direct numerical simulation for fluid-fluid displacement in 3D rough fractures and the validation with experiments were rarely reported. Here we perform 3D direct numerical simulations for drainage processes of water displacing oil in a real rough fracture with capillary number log10Ca ranging from −3 to −5. Comparison between experiments and simulations shows that the simulated results can generally reproduce the dynamic invasion morphologies at the scale of fracture. The discrepancy of the invasion morphologies, however, is observed at the local scale, mainly because the mesh resolution is not small enough compared with the scale of the interface. We then perform quantitative analysis of the simulated results to investigate the role of capillary and viscous forces. We show that Haines Jump events in the flow passage of void neck connecting to a wider void occur in the capillary-dominated flow regime. Statistical analysis of the velocity fields under various flow rate conditions shows that as the effect of viscous force becomes more important and eventually dominates that of capillarity, void-filling toward the outlet is continuously enhanced, with the velocity vector angles being more probably localized in the zone around the bulk flow direction. The direct evidence provided by the 3D numerical simulations improves our understanding of the competition of viscous and capillary forces controlling the immiscible displacement in rough fractures.},

We quantitatively investigated the oil-phase trapping mechanism using pore-scale modeling to calculate two-phase fluid flow in a single fracture with multi-scale rough surfaces. On this basis, we propose an accelerating modeling method combining wavelet decomposition and a correction function to enhance computational efficiency without compromising the accuracy of the residual oil. Our results indicate that the kinetic energy of the oil-phase flow driven by CO2 is gradually converted into pressure energy, which overcomes the oil-phase surface energy and causes the oil-phase to become trapped in some grooves on the rough fracture. Even structural details of 0.05 µm have non-negligible effects on the residual oil volume, which can be quantified using the proposed correction function. In such cases, the residual oil can be calculated accurately if the wavelet decomposition is not higher than the fourth level, where structural details of {\textless} 1.0 µm can be ignored. Computational efficiency can be enhanced six-fold when using the wavelet decomposition of the fourth level. The accelerated modeling method presented herein provides an effective representation of multiphase flow dynamics in rough fractures and offers a feasible solution for cross-scale calculations.},

	abstract = {Multiphase flow through fractures has great significance in subsurface energy recovery and gas storage applications. Different fracture and flow properties affect flow through a fracture which is difficult to control in laboratory experiments. Here, we perform lattice Boltzmann simulations in an ensemble of synthetically generated fractures. Drainage simulations are performed at different capillary numbers, wettability, and viscosity ratios. We track the invading front and quantify breakthrough saturations and show that roughness and wettability have a strong effect on fluid invasion through a complex fracture. Invading a more viscous fluid results in more stable displacement regardless of the capillary number while at very low capillary numbers, fluid migration is dependent on the inherent structure of the fracture. We develop a fluid displacement phase diagram in a single rough fracture and compare our results from that in the literature. Finally, we extend the phase diagrams across multiple fractures and demonstrate the importance of natural fracture features of roughness and wettability in identifying stable versus unstable displacement regimes during multiphase flow through rough fractures. Our work presents an end-to-end numerical pathway for testing on experimental data and expanding numerical data sets for testing combinations of different physical phenomenon and make valuable predictions on fluid flow through rough fractures.},

	abstract = {The immiscible displacement of a wetting fluid by a non-wetting fluid in rough fractures is crucial in many subsurface applications. Hydrodynamic-scale modeling of such drainage flows is challenging due to the complex interaction between the forces at play, the intricate geometry, and the required modeling of moving contact lines. In addition, a remaining critical open question is to what extent not resolving the films of wetting fluid deposited on fracture walls degrades numerical predictions. We address this question by solving the Navier–Stokes equations, employing the volume-of-fluid method to capture fluid–fluid interfaces and considering numerical meshes that result in either resolved films (RF) or unresolved films (UF) in the simulations. The numerical model, implemented in OpenFOAM, is validated in the classical Saffman–Taylor (ST) viscous instability configuration using the original ST experimental measurements; at capillary numbers (Ca) larger than  10−3, UF simulations overpredict ST finger widths. We then address two synthetic fracture geometries: one with sinusoidally varying apertures and one with stochastic geometric properties typical of geological fractures. Predictions of RF and UF simulations are compared quantitatively for Ca ranging between  10−5 and  10−3. Wetting film thicknesses follow a power law of Ca similar to Bretherton's law. RF and UF approaches both predict similar invasion patterns, but the latter underestimates interfacial lengths and macroscopic pressure drops, as compared to RF simulations, while overpredicting invading fluid saturations and breakthrough times. These discrepancies increase with Ca, whereas the disordered nature of the geological fracture tends to limit them. For  Ca\&lt;10−5, the discrepancies are negligible.},

	abstract = {Two-phase flow in fractured geo-material plays a significant role in various subsurface processes. In this study, the realistic issues regarding two-phase flow in rough-walled fractures (RWFs) with different surface wettability are initially investigated with an improved approach based on the free energy multiphase lattice Boltzmann model and a novel rough-walled discrete fracture network model. After validation with analytical solutions, the proposed model is applied to investigate the co-current flow of two immiscible fluids in RWFs at different surface wettability conditions, and the impact of contact angle and fracture aperture on fluid flow distribution, velocity field, and relative permeability curves are further clarified. For fluid initially distributed near the surface, its relative permeability increases monotonically with its saturation. For fluid flowing as the bulk phase, when its saturation is low, its relative permeability decreases with the decrease of its saturation. However, when its saturation is high (about 0.6–0.9), its relative permeability in RWFs exposes instabilities and could be lower than that in smoothed wall fractures, meaning additional flow resistance exists in RWFs. According to our simulation results and theoretical analysis, this phenomenon is mainly caused by the wettability-related microscale fluid distribution. In RWFs with small aperture, the fluid–solid surface interaction dominates, the distribution and flow pattern of fluid flowing near the surface alters the “apparent roughness” of the fracture and further impact the relative permeability curves.},

	abstract = {Fluid–mineral and fluid–rock interfaces are key parameters controlling the reactivity and fate of fluids in reservoir rocks and aquifers. The interface dynamics through space and time results from complex processes involving a tight coupling between chemical reactions and transport of species as well as a strong dependence on the physical, chemical, mineralogical and structural properties of the reacting solid phases. In this article, we review the recent advances in pore-scale imaging and reactive flow modelling applied to interface dynamics. Digital rocks derived from time-lapse X-ray micro-tomography imaging gives unprecedented opportunity to track the interface evolution during reactive flow experiments in porous or fractured media, and evaluate locally mineral reactivity. The recent improvements in pore-scale reactive transport modelling allow for a fine description of flow and transport that integrates moving fluid–mineral interfaces inherent to chemical reactions. Combined with three-dimensional digital images, pore-scale reactive transport modelling complements and augments laboratory experiments. The most advanced multi-scale models integrate sub-voxel porosity and processes which relate to imaging instrument resolution and improve upscaling possibilities. Two example applications based on the solver porousMedia4Foam illustrate the dynamics of the interface for different transport regimes (i.e., diffusive- to advective-dominant) and rock matrix properties (i.e., permeable vs. impermeable, and homogeneous vs. polymineralic). These parameters affect both the interface roughness and its geometry evolution, from sharp front to smeared (i.e., diffuse) interface. The paper concludes by discussing the challenges associated with precipitation processes in porous media, rock texture and composition (i.e., physical and mineralogical heterogeneity), and upscaling to larger scales.},

	abstract = {The dissolution dynamics of rough channels is a fundamental issue involved in widening fracture channels (cavity evolution), solution mining, and upscaling of dissolution rate. Previous studies have focused on the dissolution patterns at the sample scale, but the study of rough surface evolution at the pore scale is lacking. Here, we fabricate a soluble microfluidic chip with rough channels to investigate pore-scale dissolution dynamics. Through direct, real-time imaging of dissolution processes together with micro-PIV measurements, we observe two distinct dissolution patterns and the roughness smoothing effect. The smoothing effect is characterized by the disappearance of small-scale peaks and the rapid decline of the surface roughness factor. We demonstrate that this smoothing effect is attributed to the heterogeneous dissolution rates resulting from surface roughness. Through micro-PIV measurements, we quantify that the roughness smoothing significantly affects the local mass transfer rate by modifying local flow velocity at the scale of 200 μm and by shrinking the diffusion zone (including eddy) at the scale of 2 mm, accelerating the mass transfer rate between diffusion and main flow zones. Due to the smoothing effect, the enhanced local mass transfer rate eventually intensifies the overall dissolution rate. Finally, we provide a theoretical prediction for the transition of two dissolution patterns, which agrees well with experimental observation. Our work develops a useful tool for studying the pore-scale dissolution behavior in 2D rough channels and improves our understanding of how the pore-scale dissolution behavior affects the overall dissolution rate and dissolution patterns.},

To describe the reactive-transportation and distribution morphology of a uranium-containing solution, a stress-dependent reactive transport model was developed, and the simulator of FLAC3D-CFD was employed. The uranium transport experiment subjected to the variation of confining stress of 5–19 MPa and hydraulic pressure of 0.5–3.5 MPa was conducted in fractured rock mass. The results show that the uranium-containing solution transport and distribution is significantly dependent on the evolution of the connected channel in rough-walled fracture, which is significantly influenced by the confining stress and hydraulic pressure. In more detail, the increase of confining stress resulted in the anisotropic of seepage channel in aperture, and corresponding turbulence flow and uranium retention were presented at the fracture aperture of 2–5 μm. As the increase of hydraulic pressure, flow regime evolved from the inertial flow to vortex flow, and the transformation region is 16 MPa confining stress and 1.5 MPa hydraulic pressure. The evolution of loading paths also dominates the flow and solute transport, and high seepage speed and strong solute transport were presented at the k = 1 (ratio of vertical stress loading to horizontal stress unloading), and a laminar flow and weak solute transport were presented at k = 0.},

Multiphase flow is solved using the Volume-Of-Fluid method, and the transport of species is solved using the continuous species transfer method. The reactive transport equations are solved using a sequential operator splitting method, with the transport step solved using GeoChemFoam, and the reaction step solved using Phreeqc, the US geological survey’s geochemical software.

	abstract = {In various natural and engineered systems, mineral-fluid interactions take place in the presence of multiple fluid phases. While there is evidence that the interplay between multiphase flow processes and reactions controls the evolution of these systems, investigation of the dynamics that shape this interplay at the pore scale has received little attention. Specifically, continuum scale models rarely consider the effect of multiphase flow parameters on mineral reaction rates or apply simple corrections as a function of the reactive surface area or saturation of the aqueous phase, without developing a mechanistic understanding of the pore-scale dynamics. In this study, we developed a framework that couples the two-phase flow simulator of OpenFOAM with the geochemical reaction capability of CrunchTope to examine pore-scale dynamics of two phase flow and their impacts on mineral reaction rates. For our investigations, flat 2D channels and single sine wave channels were used to represent smooth and rough geometries. Calcite dissolution in these channels was quantified with single phase flow and two phase flow at a range of velocities. We observed that the bulk calcite dissolution rates were not only affected by the loss of reactive surface area as it becomes occupied by the non-reactive non-aqueous phase, but also largely influenced by the changes in local velocity profiles, e.g., recirculation zones, due to the presence of the non-aqueous phase. The extent of the changes in reaction rates in the two-phase systems compared to the corresponding single phase system is dependent on the flow rate (i.e., capillary number) and channel geometry, and follows a non-monotonic relationship with respect to aqueous saturation. The pore-scale simulation results can be used to better constrain reaction rate descriptions in multiphase continuum scale models. These results also emphasize the need for experimental studies that underpin the development of mechanistic models for multiphase flow in reactive systems.},

We discuss insights into the evolution of geological forms that can be inferred from these feedback mechanisms, as well as some geotechnical applications such as enhanced oil recovery, hydraulic fracturing, and carbon sequestration. Until recently, most practical applications of reactive transport have been based on Darcy-scale modeling, where averaged equations for the flow and reactant transport are solved. We summarize the successes and limitations of volume averaging, which leads to Darcy-scale equations, as an introduction to pore-scale modeling. Pore-scale modeling is computationally intensive but offers new insights as well as tests of averaging theories and pore-network models.

Using concepts of fractional Brownian motion and surface roughness characterizations with laser profilometer, we first generated three rough-walled microfractures consistent with three laboratory experiments (i.e., E4, E5 and E6). After that, the generated microfractures were subjected to a confining pressure in accord with experimental conditions, and geomechanical deformation was simulated. We used the OpenFOAM software package to simulate the fluid flow and permeability. By comparing the simulated permeability values with the experimentally measured ones we found relative errors equal to 28, 15 and 200\% respectively for the experiments E4, E5 and E6. After calibration, however, the relative error dropped below 4\%. We next simulated the reactive transport using the GeoChemFOAM solver and investigated permeability evolution in the deformed microfractures. We found that after 10 hrs of reactive transport simulations, permeability increased by 47\%, on average, in all cases studied here.},

	abstract = {Quantitative predictions of natural and induced phenomena in fractured rock is one of the great challenges in the Earth and Energy Sciences with far-reaching economic and environmental impacts. Fractures occupy a very small volume of a subsurface formation but often dominate fluid flow, solute transport and mechanical deformation behavior. They play a central role in CO2 sequestration, nuclear waste disposal, hydrogen storage, geothermal energy production, nuclear nonproliferation, and hydrocarbon extraction. These applications require predictions of fracture-dependent quantities of interest such as CO2 leakage rate, hydrocarbon production, radionuclide plume migration, and seismicity; to be useful, these predictions must account for uncertainty inherent in subsurface systems. Here, we review recent advances in fractured rock research covering field- and laboratory-scale experimentation, numerical simulations, and uncertainty quantification. We discuss how these have greatly improved the fundamental understanding of fractures and one's ability to predict flow and transport in fractured systems. Dedicated field sites provide quantitative measurements of fracture flow that can be used to identify dominant coupled processes and to validate models. Laboratory-scale experiments fill critical knowledge gaps by providing direct observations and measurements of fracture geometry and flow under controlled conditions that cannot be obtained in the field. Physics-based simulation of flow and transport provide a bridge in understanding between controlled simple laboratory experiments and the massively complex field-scale fracture systems. Finally, we review the use of machine learning-based emulators to rapidly investigate different fracture property scenarios and accelerate physics-based models by orders of magnitude to enable uncertainty quantification and near real-time analysis.},

	abstract = {Development of models and dedicated numerical methods for dynamics in fractured rocks is an active research field, with research moving towards increasingly advanced process couplings and complex fracture networks. The inclusion of coupled processes in simulation models is challenged by the high aspect ratio of the fractures, the complex geometry of fracture networks and the crucial impact of processes that completely change characteristics on the fracture-rock interface. This paper provides a general discussion of design principles for introducing fractures in simulators, and defines a framework for integrated modeling, discretization and computer implementation. The framework is implemented in the simulation software PorePy, which can serve as a flexible prototyping tool or multiphysics problems in fractured rocks. Based on a representation of the fractures and their intersections as lower-dimensional objects, we discuss data structures for mixed-dimensional meshes, formulation of multiphysics problems and discretizations that utilize existing software. We further present the implementation of these concepts in the PorePy open-source software tool, which is aimed at coupled simulation of flow and transport in three-dimensional fractured reservoirs as well as deformation of fractures and the reservoir in general. We present validation by benchmarks for flow, poroelasticity and fracture deformation in fractured porous media. The flexibility of the framework is then illustrated by simulations of fully coupled flow and transport and of injection driven deformation of fractures. All results reported herein can be reproduced by openly available simulation scripts.},

	abstract = {Microwave irradiation, as a novel rock breakage assistance technique, has shown significant potential in underground rock engineering. This study proposes a numerical method combining COMSOL and peridynamics (PD) to investigate the spatiotemporal coupling of the electromagnetic, temperature, mechanical fields, and damage evolution of rock under microwave irradiation. This method’s validity is confirmed by comparing simulation results with experiments. The results show that electromagnetic wave reflection and superposition within the cavity cause uneven electromagnetic field distribution in the rock, leading to localized high temperatures (“hot spots”) and stress concentration. Damage initiates in the hotspot below the borehole and expands over time. The m value, representing the interaction range between material points, shows that smaller m values cause more lateral damage expansion, while larger m values reduce overall damage extent, highlighting the significant effect of horizon radius on damage patterns and expansion paths. Compared to previous methods, the PD method more accurately and flexibly captures the details and evolution of rock damage, demonstrating great potential for studying rock damage mechanisms under multi-physics coupling conditions.},

This study used granite as the research object and analysed electromagnetic–thermal characteristics and dynamic tensile characteristics of microwave-irradiated granite. The microwave irradiation problem was decomposed into the electromagnetic–thermal unidirectional coupling and thermal–mechanical unidirectional coupling problems for numerical solutions, and the weakening mechanism of microwave irradiation was discussed at the microscopic level. The results showed that the thermal stress generated by the rapid heating and selective heating characteristics of microwave irradiation is the dominant factor in microwave fracturing. The presence of thermal cracks affects the crack extension path, making the failure more complicated. Tensile failure is the primary mechanical mechanism that causes the macroscopic fracture of the specimen, and intergranular failure dominates the overall failure of the specimen. Microwave irradiation reduces the shear resistance of the specimen. Microscopically, the proportion of shear cracks gradually increases with the increasing of irradiation duration (TM). Macroscopically, the area of the wedge-shaped failure zone gradually increases.},

This approach to power delivery is applied to ascertain whether the strength of porphyry copper ore can be reduced with lower average modulated power levels than using continuous power. Changes in resistance to breakage of the treated and untreated ore were quantified by comparative drop weight tests. Mineralogical investigation for the ore was carried out with the Mineral Liberation Analyser (MLA) for surface identification of minerals and X-ray tomography for volumetric analysis. The comparative drop weight tests showed that material treated for 5s at 5kW of modulated power was weaker than untreated material. However, for this particular low grade ore, the degree of breakage which was achieved could be achieved with substantially less mechanical energy. It is possible that by using much higher level of microwave power, better liberation might be achieved than using conventional methods.},

	abstract = {Microwave energy can be used to assist mechanical rock breakage for civil and mining engineering operations. To assess the industrial applicability of this technology, microwave heating of basalt specimens in a multi-mode cavity (a microwave chamber) at different power levels was followed by conventional mechanical strength and fragmentation effect tests in the laboratory. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to determine the mineral composition and distribution of the basalt, to aid interpretation of crack propagation patterns and the associated strength reduction mechanism. These analyses demonstrated that cracks mainly occurred around olivine grains, primarily as intergranular cracks between olivine and plagioclase grains and intragranular cracks within olivine grains. Strength reduction during microwave fracturing of basalt is driven by heat from enstatite (a microwave-sensitive mineral) and volumetric expansion of olivine (a thermally expansive mineral). Uniaxial compressive, Brazilian tensile, and point load strengths all decreased with increasing microwave irradiation time at rates that were positively related to the power level. For a given power level, mechanical strength reduction can be estimated from linear relationships with irradiation time. On the other hand, a power function best described burst time (the irradiation time at which the specimen burst into fragments) vs. power level (for a given specimen size) and burst time vs. specimen size (for a given power level) relationships. Microwave-induced hard rock fracturing can be an integral part of new methods for rock breakage and tunnel excavation.},

In the literature, there is a significant discrepancy in the loss factors (i.e., the ability of minerals in absorbing microwave energy) of the gangue minerals due to the fact that different unsuitable and inconsistent measurement techniques are used. In this paper, the dielectric properties (i.e., the dielectric constant \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\}\$\$ and loss factor \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime\}\$\$) of 14 high-grade minerals, including 11 gangue minerals and 3 ore minerals that form most of the commonly found igneous and metamorphic hard rocks, were obtained using a customised resonant cavity and the effective medium theory at 2.45 GHz and room temperature. These minerals could be classified into three categories (i.e., low, medium and high loss) based on the magnitude of their loss factors. For the low-loss and medium-loss gangue minerals, their loss factors hardly correlate to either one or a combination of the metal elements or the crystal system. The dielectric properties of minerals were then used to explain the behaviour difference of granite and basalt when exposed to microwave radiation.},

Using a multimode microwave cavity, it was found that strength could be significantly reduced in 0.5 s when using 15 kW of microwave power. Lower powers in this type of cavity were found to be less effective. Drop weight tests were used to quantify the change in strength in terms of reduction in required comminution energy. Reductions of up to 40\% were achieved for particles of mean size 14.53 mm. Preliminary tests in a single-mode microwave cavity gave strength reductions of 50\% at 10 kW of microwave power with a residence time of only 0.1 s, indicating that high electric field strength is important in the failure of ore.

In this article, the techno-economy of microwave-assisted impact hammer breakage of hard rocks was investigated. Microwave heating tests of 50-cm cubic biotite diorite blocks were carried out, followed by temperature measurement, ultrasonic velocity tests, Schmidt hammer rebound tests and rock breakage tests. The fracturing characteristics, the interaction between the radiation locations and the rock breaking by impact hammer were comprehensively investigated. The results show that the microwave system is efficient in fracturing the diorite. Cracks generated by the subsequent radiation tend to develop toward the centre of, or the cracks generated by, the previous radiation. Cracks produced by the previous radiations can be widened and extended by a following radiation. The maximum length and width of crack increase with the increase of the microwave power and heating time. Rock breakage tests demonstrate that microwave treatment greatly weakens the specimens and improves the efficiency of rock breaking by impact hammer.

The model is first validated against experimental test and then used to simulate the damage and fracturing of rock under microwave radiation at various microwave power levels and radiation times. The simulations show that the distribution of temperature in the rock sample is extremely non-uniform, resulting in high thermal gradients that can damage and/or fracture the rock sample. Higher power levels and longer durations impart more damage. The simulations also show, under the same microwave radiation conditions, that the resultant sample temperature, and therefore damage, is higher in samples with high ratios of compressive to tensile strength. A good agreement between the modeling and experimental results suggests that the model can be used to assist in the management and optimization of mineral mining, oil and gas recovery, and deep Earth energy recovery.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the magnitude of microwave-induced fractures is dependent on ore mineralogy and texture. Those studies were based on quantitative measurements of ore competency through destructive testing or one-dimensional non-destructive ultrasonic testing, and thus did not provide detailed information about the damage (e.g., 3D fracture mapping). In this study, the role of mineralogy and texture was investigated using the X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) imaging technique to provide 3D visualization and quantification of microwave-induced fractures in four porphyry copper ores of varying lithology. The extent of mineral exposure resulting from microwave treatment was determined by comparing the Euclidean Distance Map (EDM) of pre- and post-treated scanning results, which can be used to inform leaching performance and thus select suitable ore types for microwave-assisted leaching. Ores that exhibited a greater increase in flaw thickness (up to 0.8 mm) and a higher mineral exposure (shortening the leaching pathways by up to 45 \%) due to microwave treatment tended to have similar mineralogical features. The features included a high modal abundance of good microwave heaters (∼7–14 \%), a coarse grain size or micro-veins of these heaters (average D50 = 300–500 µm), and contained a significant proportion of stiffer microwave heaters (e.g., pyrite) (5–11 \%). Given the right mineralogy and texture, this study indicates that microwave ore pre-treatment is a potential technology that can significantly increase mineral exposure (reducing leaching pathways) by inducing macro-fractures, which can be exploited to improve metal extraction without further size reduction (e.g., in heap leaching). Alternatively, if the coarsely treated fragments are crushed, the internal mineral will be exposed due to preferential breakage along induced fracture paths, potentially promoting metal leach extraction.},

Experimental tests validate the rationality of the proposed model. Embedding microscopic mineral sections into the granite model for simulation shows that uneven temperature gradients create distinct molten, porous, and nonmolten zones on the fracture surface. Moreover, the varying thermal expansion coefficients and Young’s moduli among the minerals induce significant thermal stress at the mineral boundaries. Quartz and biotite with higher thermal expansion coefficients are subjected to compression, whereas plagioclase with smaller coefficients experiences tensile stress. In the molten zone, quartz undergoes transgranular cracking due to the α–β phase transition. The local high temperatures also induce melting phase transitions in biotite and feldspar. This numerical study provides new insights into the distribution of thermal stress and mineral phase changes in rocks under microwave irradiation.},

Thus, understanding the influence of damage induced by microwave irradiation on rock fragmentation is necessary. In this context, cylindrical Fangshan granite (FG) specimens were exposed to microwave irradiation at a power of 6 kW for different durations up to 4.5 min. The damages of the specimens induced by irradiation were quantified by using both X-ray micro-CT scanning and ultrasonic wave measurement. The CT value and P-wave velocity decreased with increase of irradiation duration. The irradiated specimens were then tested using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system to simulate rock fragmentation. A momentum-trap technique was utilized to ensure single-pulse loading on the specimen in SHPB tests, enabling valid fragment size distribution (FSD) analysis. The dependence of dynamic uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) on the irradiation duration and loading rate was revealed. The dynamic UCS increased with increase of loading rate while decreased with increase of irradiation duration. Using the sieve analysis, three fragmentation types were proposed based on FSD, which were dictated by both loading rate and irradiation duration. In addition, an average fragment size was proposed to quantify FSD. The results showed that the average fragment size decreased with increase of loading rate. A loading rate range was identified, where a dramatic reduction of the average fragment size occurred. The dependence of fragmentation on the irradiation duration and loading rate was also discussed.},

	abstract = {Existing numerical models cannot well reproduce the fracturing process and reveal the underlying mechanisms of rocks under microwave irradiation. In this work, the electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical multiphysics is decoupled into microwave-induced heating (continuum-based) and thermally-driven fracturing (discontinuum-based), with temperature serving as the key interlink. The rigid-body spring-subset network (RBSSN) model is proposed to calculate the progressive fracturing of rocks under open-ended microwave irradiation, where the individual contacts between adjacent tetrahedral blocks are disassembled into three hypothetical spring-subsets. To depict failure characteristics of large-scale rocks under microwave irradiation, a variable-sized block model is developed by densifying the rigid-blocks near the irradiation. This electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical decoupling framework effectively captures the microwave fracturing process, revealing that microwave irradiation induces tensile-dominant progressive failure and regionalized deterioration (localized damage and macroscopic radial fissure). The fracturing rate of rocks is time-dependent, progressing through silent, violent and slowdown periods of rupturing with extended exposure time. The reason why high-power microwave is more effective in promoting visible fractures under the identical input energy is analyzed by combining the thermal deformation theory and RBSSN simulation. It is found that, power levels should be kept within reasonable scopes to maximize fracturing effects as excessive power densities lead to initiation of numerous microcracks around the high temperature zone and susceptibility to spalling.},

	abstract = {Microwave radiation is pioneered for weakening and cracking rock in the fields of tunneling and mining engineering. However, there has been limited research on the application of microwave heating for geothermal energy extraction, and the precise damage mechanism remains poorly understood. To address this gap, a fully coupled electromagnetic-thermal–mechanical model, incorporating damage variables, was established and then verified by lab tests. Simulation results of coaxial microwave heating granite show that the damage mechanism is different from that of conventional rectangular waveguide heating. Coaxial microwave heating leads to the formation of two distinct hot spots in the granite. The differential tensile stress between the interior and exterior of the borehole contributes to the damage in the upper hot spot, while the interior compressive and exterior tensile stress state induces damage in the lower hot spot. Consequently, the deformation pattern of granite assumes a vase shape, with the damaged area exhibiting a canopy shape. When the initial crack trend is 135°, the crack connectivity efficiency is maximized to 61 \% at 1.5 kW microwave power and 2.45 GHz frequency. These findings offer valuable theoretical insights for the potential application of microwave-assisted super-long gravity heat pipes in geothermal extraction.},

	abstract = {This study introduced a simplified thermodynamic model based on the regularized phase field method for simulating the thermally induced fractures of rocks pretreated by microwave. A thermo-mechanical model comprises three main parts developed to evaluate the fractures: the heat generation of the rock specimen is determined via the heat balance equation; the calculation of thermally induced stress is performed in the second part by taking into account the thermal stress due to temperature change; the third part calculates the fracture induced by microwave heating using the phase field equation. Combining these three parts enables simulations of rock fractures due to thermally induced stress. The first simulation is the quenching test of ceramics to validate the robustness of the phase field method in modelling the thermo-mechanical fracture. Then, examples of microwave-induced fracture are presented and discussed in comparison with microwave test results. A good agreement is achieved from the results of numerical analysis and experiments, which proves the feasibility of the proposed thermo-mechanical coupling fracture (phase field) model for the simulation of thermal-mechanical fractures. It is further found that the power level is crucial in influencing the fractures given the same energy input. More specifically, a higher power level leads to an increased non-uniformity of a thermal gradient, which, as a result, leads to a higher stress gradient and more fractures generated eventually. Furthermore, the energy utilization ratio also benefits under a more intensive microwave power level. The developed model quantitatively enriches the understanding of fractures produced by microwave irradiation and advances the application of the microwave-assisted rock breakage technique in industry and academics.},

	abstract = {Microwave heating is a potential and effective technology for enhancing shale gas recovery. The microwave radiation may induce cracking of the shale matrix, which further improves the permeability of reservoirs. Therefore, it is important to study the cracking characteristics of shale matrices to evaluate the permeability enhancement effect of microwave radiation on shale. This study proposes a novel dual-scale phase-field model to investigate the mechanisms of intergranular and transgranular fractures within a shale matrix subjected to microwave radiation. The model combines microwave heating modeling at the macro-scale and fracture modeling at the micro-scale with shale microstructures created through Voronoi tessellation. Each mineral grain has an elastic isotropic behavior, and multiphase aggregates (quartz, feldspar, pyrite, clay, calcite, and dolomite) are considered. Intergranular fractures are modeled using a lower-dimensional interfacial element formulation. The responses of temperature and cracking are analyzed based on combined simulations at the macro- and micro -scales. The simulations showed that the microwave heating efficiencies of clay and pyrite are significantly higher than those of the other minerals. Microwave-induced cracking within the shale matrix preferentially occurs in quartz particles, resulting from the lower critical energy release rate and mismatched thermal expansion of the various components of the shale matrix. The fracture modes are highly dependent on the shape and distribution characteristics of the mineral particles.},

	abstract = {Microwave irradiation is regarded as a promising technology to assist mechanical rock breaking for its substantial advantages in reducing cutter wear and enhancing rock fracture. Due to the high cost of laboratory experiments and field tests, numerical simulation has become the primary method to investigate key issues of microwave-assisted tunnel boring machine (TBM) cutting. In this work, an electromagnetic-thermo-mechanical coupled approach is developed to implement the numerical modelling of microwave-assisted TBM disc cutting. Different numerical methods are coupled in our model to exert their respective advantages, including the electromagnetic-thermal solution of COMSOL, thermo-mechanical fracture simulation of the lattice spring model (LSM), and rock-cutter contact treatment of discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA). The conversion from the Euler to Lagrange domain is adopted to address the motion of the electromagnetic-thermal field in the disc cutting process. The proposed coupled numerical approach is first verified by the corresponding modelling of the microwave-irradiated rock experiment, in which the coupled approach can also provide the evolution process of three-dimensional spatial rock fracturing that is hard to obtain in the experiment. Implemented into the numerical full-scale rock linear cutting experiment, our coupled approach is further applied to simulate rock disc cutting assisted by microwave irradiation. Through the numerical results, it is concluded that a moving microwave irradiation is better for reducing the cutter normal force as a whole in the disc cutting process. For the moving microwave irradiation, the cutter normal force will decrease with the increasing microwave power or decreasing moving speed, in which the microwave power plays a more significant role when the total microwave energy input remains the same. Finally, the curve of average normal force reduction with the microwave energy input at the engineering scale is analysed based on the numerical results of our coupled model, which provides some insights and suggestions for the future practical application of microwave-assisted TBM tunnelling.},

In this study, the experimental tests using open-ended microwave and numerical simulations coupling COMSOL Multiphysics and four-dimensional lattice spring model (4D-LSM) were carried out to investigate the evolution process of microwave-induced cracks, and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for size-dependent microwave-induced fracturing. The experiments show that with the increase of the specimen dimension, the number of microwave-induced cracks is almost constant, and the total crack length first increases and then decreases, while the maximum crack width and maximum crack depth decrease gradually. A comparison of the experimental and numerical temperature characteristics as well as cracking characteristics indicates that the models established in this study are reasonable in the simulation of the rock fracturing behaviours. The numerical results show that the crack initiation time increases logarithmically with the increase of the specimen dimension. For the small-sized specimens, the microwave-induced cracks started from the outer boundary of the specimen and propagated toward to specimen center and into the depth. For the medium-sized and large-sized specimens, the microwave-induced cracks initiated near the outer boundary of the antenna aperture, and then propagated toward to the center of the specimen and the outer boundary of the specimen. The main reason for the size-dependent of fracturing behavior is that the local fracture energy will dramatically decrease when the crack is approaching the specimen boundary.},

This might be attributed, on the one hand, to the theoretical complexity involved in multi-physical phenomena, and on the other hand, to the cumbersome implementation of these coupled models in home-made platforms. In this work, the phase-field cohesive zone model (PF-CZM) is adopted as the prototype model to address fracture in various multi-physics problems, e.g., the thermo-mechanical, chemo-mechanical, chemo-thermo-mechanical, electro-mechanical, etc. The relevant theoretical and numerical aspects are categorized into modular structures, and the open-source implementations in the software platform Comsol Multiphysics are presented in details. In order to validate the PF-CZM for fracture in multi-physics problems and its numerical implementation, a number of representative benchmark examples are considered. Not only the qualitative crack patterns but also the quantitative global responses are compared against available experimental test data. It is found that the typical characteristics of fracture in all the considered multi-physics problems are well captured. Moreover, as in the purely mechanical counterpart, the predicted crack pattern and global responses are insensitive to the phase-field length scale, making the PF-CZM promising for modeling fracture in other more involved multi-physics problems.},

	abstract = {The optimal design, reliable manufacture and durable utilization of electromechanical systems demand objective modeling of failure under coupled electric field and mechanical actions. This is still a challenging and largely an open issue despite the large volumes of contributions from the discontinuous approach and the phase-field community for brittle fracture. In this work we propose a length scale insensitive phase-field cohesive zone model (PF-CZM) for electromechanical fracture in linear piezoelectric solids, overcoming all the issues of mesh dependence, crack tracking complexity, length scale sensitivity and crack nucleation inconsistency. More specifically, in the electromechanically coupled phase-field constitutive relations, the evolution law for the crack phase-field is established from the geometric regularization of sharp cracks and the energetic criterion in global form. In order to capture the unsymmetric mechanical and electrical fracture behavior, the mechanical energy release rate contributed from the positive cone of the effective stress in energy norm is employed as the crack driving force, resulting in a hybrid formulation. With a set of phase-field characteristic functions optimal for cohesive fracture, the critical stress upon crack nucleation and the post-peak softening regime are derived in close-form for the first time, and the experimentally observed effects of the electric field on the fracture load are predicted qualitatively. The proposed electromechanical PF-CZM is numerically implemented in the multi-field finite element method and applied to several representative examples. In all cases, as those for purely mechanical problems, the predicted crack patterns and fracture loads are insensitive to the phase-field length scale and the experimental results are well reproduced. In particular, the effect of electric field on the deflection of crack paths can be captured. These merits make the proposed PF-CZM promising in the modeling of electromechanical fracture in piezoelectric solids.},

The emergence of corner-flow events is found to promote a compact displacement pattern, leading to a maximum recovery efficiency of the defending fluid under the strong imbibition for both favorable and unfavorable displacement scenarios. Saturation of the invading fluid manifests the crossover in the displacement patterns from fingering to stable flow, as the wetting varies from drainage to strong imbibition. Quantifying the corner flow under both displacement conditions and strong imbibition reveals that corner-flow events are preferentially hosted by small-size pores and predominantly concentrated ahead of the primary fluid–fluid interface without perturbing the stability of the pore-body displacement. In addition to the numerical simulation, we developed an analytical model that can predict the saturation profile of invading fluid under given boundary conditions.

However, the microscopic description of multiphase flow is challenging due to fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interactions combined with complex pore topology. Thus, a systematic review of multiphase flow from molecular to pore scale perspectives is necessary. This work summarizes recent progress in numerical modeling of multiphase flow from molecular scale, pore scale, and reservoir scale simulations considering micro- and nanoscale effects. The analysis focuses on immiscible and miscible flow associated with liquid and gas phases, highlighting the micro- and nanoscale effects on the flow characteristics. Molecular simulations capture nanoscale effects such as adsorption, diffusion, and slip behaviors. The variation of wettability, pressure, and fluid saturation leads to film, slug, and droplet flows in nanopores. Pore scale simulations explain complex flow behaviors in microporous and nanoporous media. Capillary number and wettability lead to different invasion morphologies. Adsorption and slip effects are non-negligible for fluid flow in nanoporous media. Furthermore, there are obvious differences in reservoir simulation results with and without considering micro- and nanoscale effects.

We trained our network to extract spatial relationships between the porous medium morphology and the fluid velocity field. Our workflow computes simple geometrical information from 3D binary images to train a deep neural network (the PoreFlow-Net) optimized to generalize the problem of flow through porous materials. Our results show that the extracted information is sufficient to obtain accurate flow field predictions in less than a second, without performing expensive numerical simulations providing a speed-up of several orders of magnitude. We also demonstrate that our model, trained with simple synthetic geometries, is able to provide accurate results in real samples spanning granular rocks, carbonates, and slightly consolidated media from a variety of subsurface formations, which highlights the ability of the model to generalize the porous media flow problem. The workflow presented here shows the successful application of a disruptive technology (physics-based training of machine learning models) to the digital rock physics community.},

and geoenergy engineering. Understanding and properly simulating multi-phase flow phenomena
at both micro and macro scales is fundamental in particular in the view of underground

Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for modeling multi-phase flows through underground porous
media, aiming at highlighting the advantages, and the possible approaches for single-phase and
multi-phase flow. Moreover, an algorithmic analysis is given in single-phase and compared to more
popular multi-phase Lattice Boltzmann models proposed and their main computing strategies.
Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of flow in porous structures has become popular in recent years
due to the novel high-performance computing architectures, which involve many cores or threads

	abstract = {Summary. Multiphase flow behavior in the complex porous media of lacustrine shale oil is critical to the oil production performance. Shale oil reservoir processes spatial spaces of multiscale porous media. In view of the mesoscopic scale, the fluids flow behaviors of shale oil reservoirs are significantly different from that of tight oil reservoirs and the multimedia flow fluxes in shale have to be reevaluated. Furthermore, upscaling methods from the mesoscopic scale to the macroscopic level as well as coupling methods of multimedia mass transfer have not been adequately established. Based on the multiple media model, such as organic-inorganic matter system and embedded discrete fracture model (DFM), this work proposes a multiscale porous media flow simulation method that is applicable for lacustrine shale oil reservoirs. In the model, various reservoir matrix and flow spaces, such as organic pores, intragranular pores, intergranular pores, and fracture networks composed of bedding fractures and hydraulic fractures, are included. Methods of mass flux conductivity estimations among multiscale media and the relevant upgrading methods are also proposed. Validation of the model is first conducted by the comparison of the oil production performance estimated by the proposed model and a theory solution, and the model is further compared to Gulong shale oil reservoir data to determine its availability in field application. The results show that the proposed simulation model is capable of accurately characterizing the multiphase flow characteristics in multiscale media in shale. It is further demonstrated that the proposed model significantly improves the simulation accuracy over the current nonupscaling models. Field study shows that, based on the accurate characterization of the complex flows in shale oil reservoirs, the research output can provide support for future development of the Gulong shale oil reservoir.},

However, in the literature, many competing algorithms have been proposed for accomplishing different steps in the CGM. Therefore, this paper is the first in a series that aims to critically review and evaluate different algorithms and methodologies that have been proposed for use in the CGM. Specifically, in this paper, we (1) provide a brief introduction to the LBM and CGM that enables and facilitates consideration of more sophisticated topics subsequently; (2) compare three methods for modeling the behavior of fluids of moderately different viscosities; (3) compare two methods for calculating the color gradient; and (4) compare two methods for modeling external forces or accelerations acting upon the fluids of interest. These topics are selected for the first paper in the series because proper selection of these algorithms is necessary and sufficient to perform two common “benchmark” simulations, namely bubble tests and layered Poiseuille flow. Future papers in the series will build upon these topics, considering more challenging conditions or phenomena. By systematically reviewing key aspects, features, capabilities, and limitations of the CGM, this series of papers will extend our collective ability to apply the method to a variety of important fluid flow problems in geosciences and engineering.},

Moreover, an improved algorithm is proposed to characterize and implement the apparent wettability in the locally homogenized porosity field. Validations and test cases are given to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of this new model, as well as its applicability for trans-scale fluid simulation of transport and sorption behavior from porous (Darcy flow) area to free (Stokes flow) area. For practicality, the two-phase seepage flow in a composite rock structure with multiscale pores is simulated by this new model, and the effects of viscosity ratio and wettability on the displacement process are discussed.},

	abstract = {A two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is applied to investigate the use of various equations of state (EoS) for the simulation of liquid–vapor two-phase flow systems with considering the wetting properties, namely the hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, for solid surfaces. The pseudo-potential single-component multiphase Shan–Chen model is used to resolve inter-particle interactions and phase change between the liquid and its vapor. Several EoSs, including the Redlich–Kwong (R–K), Carnahan-Starling (C–S), and Peng–Robinson (P–R) in comparison with the Shan–Chen (S–C) model are considered to study their effects on the numerical simulation results in terms of density ratios, spurious velocities and the contact angle of the two-phase flow with the solid wall. Accuracy and performance of the multiphase LBM by incorporating various EoSs are examined by solving two-phase flow systems at different conditions. Herein, three test cases considered are an equilibrium state of a droplet suspended in the vapor phase, a liquid droplet located on the solid surface, and a liquid droplet motion through a grooved channel with different wetting conditions. The results obtained demonstrate that implementation of the wall boundary condition with the wettability effects significantly impacts the numerical stability of the LBM with the EoSs employed for simulation of liquid–vapor flow problems, particularly at high-density ratio. Simulation of the equilibrium state of a droplet on a surface with considering wettability effects shows that the S–C model, R–K, P–R and C–S EoSs are stable for the maximum density ratio up to ρl∕ρv=74.6, 78.9, 4904.4 and 147, respectively. It is defined that the parasitic currents do not increase significantly due to imposing the wetting condition on the solid wall, however, the numerical solutions with considering wettability effects are more sensitive at high-density ratios. The present study demonstrates that the P–R EoS is more stable for simulation of high-density ratio liquid–vapor systems with reasonable spurious currents in the interfacial region for the flow problems with the periodic computational domain. However, with considering the wetting wall boundary condition, the C–S EoS produces less spurious velocity in the interface region, which leads to more precise and stable numerical simulations in comparison with the other EoSs applied for the equilibrium state of a liquid droplet on the solid surface. The results obtained also demonstrate the capability of the multiphase LBM for predicting practical flow characteristics with different EoSs implemented.},

We implement a partitioned, strongly coupled solver for transient fluid-solid simulations with independent conformed interface meshes for the fluid and solid domains. Fluid flow and solid computations were performed using the finite element method. External load is prescribed along the solid boundary in gradual steps to examine the extent of pore-scale deformation along internal grain walls while applying a fixed constraint at the opposite end to ensure uniform stress distribution across the media. Hydrodynamic interactions between the pore walls and the matrix leading to interface displacements by fluid viscous forces are also investigated by examining fluid flow with different combinations of Reynolds number. Coupling is achieved via traction and displacements boundary conditions at the interface with respect to Lagrangian coordinates. The role of particle shape in the matrix deformation process is also considered in this paper. In order to examine the how particle shape affects local affects local permeability/stress, we examine fluid movement based on varying Reynolds numbers in Berea sandstone obtained from Micro-CT image scans at high resolution, and artificially constructed random polydisperse 3-D sphere packs. It was found that permeability alteration under the influence of uniaxial stress was more in the sandstone sample than in the sphere-pack and that the sphere-pack deformed less than the actual sample due to pore geometry, surface smoothness, and homogeneity.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of multiphase flow dynamics in porous media is crucial for optimizing subsurface engineering applications like geological carbon sequestration. However, studying the micro-mechanisms of multiphase fluid--grain interactions in the laboratory is challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining mechanical data such as force and displacement. Transitional discrete element method models coupled with pore networks offer insights into these interactions but struggle with accurate pressure prediction during pore expansion from fracturing and efficient simulation during the slow drainage of compressible fluids. To address these limitations, we develop an advanced two-way coupled hydro-mechanical discrete element method model that accurately and efficiently captures fluid--fluid and fluid--grain interactions in deformable porous media. Our model integrates an unconditionally stable implicit finite volume approach, enabling significant timesteps for advancing fluids. A pressure-volume iteration scheme dynamically balances injection-induced pressure buildup with substantial pore structure deformation, while flow front-advancing criteria precisely locate the fluid--fluid interface and adaptively refine timesteps, particularly when capillary effects block potential flow paths. The model is validated against benchmark Hele-Shaw experiments in both rigid and deformable porous media, providing quantitative insights into the micro-mechanisms governing multiphase flow. For the first time, grain-scale inputs such as viscous and capillary pressures, energies, contact forces, and flow resistances are utilized to provide a detailed understanding of micro-scale fluid--fluid and fluid--grain flow patterns and their transitions.},

A cascaded LBM is used to simulate the liquid–gas flow field using a pseudopotential interaction model for describing the liquid–gas multiphase behaviour. A classical DEM resorting to fictitious overlaps between the particles is used to simulate the multiple-solid-particle system. A multiphase fluid–solid two-way coupling algorithm between LBM and DEM is constructed. The model is validated by four benchmarks: (i) single disc sedimentation, (ii) single floating particle on a liquid–gas interface, (iii) sinking of a horizontal cylinder and (iv) self-assembly of three particles on a liquid–gas interface. Our simulations agree well with the numerical results reported in the literature. Our proposed model is further applied to simulate droplet impact on deformable granular porous media at pore scale. The dynamic droplet spreading process, the deformation of the porous media (composed of up to 1277 solid particles) as well as the invasion of the liquid into the pores are well captured, within a wide range of impact Weber number. The droplet spreading dynamics on particles is analysed based on the energy budget, which reveals mechanisms at play, showing the evolution of particle energy, surface energy and viscous dissipation energy. A scaling relation based on the impact Weber number is proposed to describe the maximum spreading ratio.},

By means of numerical simulation based on the improved smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, a specific kernel function approximate integral interpolation form and discrete particle superposition expression form are constructed to handle physical processes. The maximum tensile stress criterion and fracture marker ω are introduced to improve the traditional smooth kernel function for dealing with crack propagation. Meanwhile, the center and radius information of circular pores are generated using random numbers to create a rock model with random pores. The research results show that in terms of crack propagation morphology, as the pore percentage increases, the crack gradually changes from a straight propagation slightly disturbed by pores to an overall fragmentation propagation with frequent branching and coalescence; when the pore size increases, the crack propagation changes from a complex network-like shape frequently disturbed by small pores to a relatively simple through fracture controlled by key nodes of large pores. In terms of the stress–strain law, the increase in pore percentage leads to a decrease in the elastic modulus and peak strength of the rock and a weakened post-peak ductility; when the pore size increases, the elastic modulus first decreases and then increases, the peak strength changes similarly, and the post-peak characteristics change from complex fluctuations to a stable transition. The conclusion indicates that the pore percentage and size have a significant and complex influence on the mechanical properties of the rock.},

In contrast to previous works, our formulation solves for a single distribution function with a standard velocity set and avoids any recourse to finite difference approximations. As a result, all computational benefits of the lattice Boltzmann method can be used to full capacity. The novel scheme is systematically derived using the asymptotic expansion technique and a detailed analysis of the leading-order error behavior is provided. As demonstrated by a linear stability analysis, the method is stable for a very large range of Poisson’s ratios. We consider periodic problems to focus on the governing equations and rule out the influence of boundary conditions.

The construction of the numerical scheme uses an equivalent first-order hyperbolic system of equations as an intermediate step, for which a vectorial lattice Boltzmann formulation is introduced. The only difference to conventional lattice Boltzmann formulations is the usage of vector-valued populations, so that all computational benefits of the algorithm are preserved. Using the asymptotic expansion technique and the notion of pre-stability structures we further establish second-order consistency as well as analytical stability estimates.

For Dirichlet boundary conditions, a modified version of the bounce-back method is developed, whereas the Neumann boundary conditions are based on a novel generalized ansatz proposed in this work.

	abstract = {A diffuse interface-lattice Boltzmann model is proposed for modeling conjugate heat transfer problems with imperfect interfaces. According to the continuity condition of heat flux and jump condition of temperature across the imperfect interface, a unified sharp interface equation of the temperature field with a singular source term in the composite media domain is established. Then a diffuse interface equation is obtained by making a smoothed approximation of the unified sharp interface equation. The novel diffuse interface equation is restructured into a second-order heat diffusion equation with an anisotropic diffusion coefficient tensor. To numerically solve the second-order anisotropic diffusion equation, a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann (LB) scheme is employed. Several numerical simulations of benchmark test examples with analytical solutions are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of the present model, including the steady-state heat diffusion in a two-layer medium with a flat interface, steady heat diffusion in a square domain with a curved interface and unsteady-state temperature diffusion with two-layer media. The numerical results show that the phenomenon of temperature jump across the imperfect interface can be successfully and correctly captured. Moreover, as an example of practical application, the new proposed diffuse interface model is utilized to predict the effective thermal conductivity of porous media with thermal contact resistance at pore scale. The variation law of the effective thermal conductivity is obtained for each parameter by studying the effects of thermal conductivity ratios of the dual-component material, the shape and volume fraction of blocks in the material, the interfacial thermal conductance coefficient, and the number of blocks on the effective thermal conductivity. Both uniform and random pore structures are considered. The previous theoretical equations strongly support the validity of the present model.},

The LBM is attractive as an elastodynamic solver because it can be parallelised readily and lends itself to finely discretised simulations of dynamic effects in continua, allowing transient phenomena such as wave propagation to be modeled efficiently. This work proposes simple local boundary rules which approximate the behaviour of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions with an LBM for elastic solids. The boundary rules are shown to be consistent with the target boundary values in the first order. An empirical convergence study is performed for the transient tension loading of a rectangular plate, with a Finite Element (FE) simulation being used as a reference.

	abstract = {Biot's consolidation model is a classical model for the evolution of deformable porous media saturated by a fluid and has various interdisciplinary applications. While numerical solution methods to solve poroelasticity by typical schemes such as finite differences, finite volumes or finite elements have been intensely studied, lattice Boltzmann methods for poroelasticity have not been developed yet. In this work, we propose a novel semi-implicit coupling of lattice Boltzmann methods to solve Biot's consolidation model in two dimensions. To this end, we use a single-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method for reaction-diffusion equations to solve the Darcy flow and combine it with a recent pseudo-time multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann scheme for quasi-static linear elasticity by Boolakee, Geier and De Lorenzis (2023, DOI: 10.1016/j.cma.2022.115756). The numerical results demonstrate that naive coupling schemes lead to instabilities when the poroelastic system is strongly coupled. However, the newly developed centered coupling scheme using fully explicit and semi-implicit contributions is stable and accurate in all considered cases, even for the Biot--Willis coefficient being one. Furthermore, the numerical results for Terzaghi's consolidation problem and a two-dimensional extension thereof highlight that the scheme is even able to capture discontinuous solutions arising from instantaneous loading.},

Fracture mechanics as a viable application for these methods has been presented before, albeit for mode III cracks in the context of an LBM for antiplane shear deformation. The performance of the LBM itself is promising, while the usage of a regular lattice simplifies the modelling of fractures significantly. Recent advancements in LBMs for solids, especially the description of Dirichlet- and Neumann-type boundary conditions, now make it possible to extend the LBM simulation of crack propagation to the plane strain case with modes I and II crack opening, including growth with non-uniform speed in arbitrary directions. For this, the configurational force acting on a crack tip is utilised. The definition of the moments of the LBM, which are based on the balance laws of continuum mechanics, render the evaluation of macroscopic fields in the configuration straightforward. In this work, the general in-plane case of dynamic crack propagation is shown and necessary considerations for the implementation are discussed. Lastly, numerical examples showcase the capabilities of the proposed method to model dynamic fractures and establish a proof-of-concept.},

Program Title: CooLBM: A GPU-Accelerated Collaborative Open-Source Reactive Multi-Phase/Component Simulation Code via Lattice Boltzmann Method CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/79p5z26scz.1 Developer's repository link: https://gitlab.coria-cfd.fr/lbm/coolbm Licensing provisions: GNU GPLv3 Programming language: C++ Nature of problem: Multi-phase and multi-component reactive flows are fundamental to numerous industrial and engineering applications, including combustion systems, energy storage, and environmental processes. These flows often exhibit complex interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales, requiring numerical modeling to accurately capture the underlying physics. Despite significant advancements, existing numerical methods often encounter limitations due to the high computational cost associated with resolving these intricate flow dynamics. Many state-of-the-art numerical solving tools require expensive commercial licenses, restricting their accessibility for researchers and engineers. While open-source alternatives exist, they require an in-depth understanding of the code structure, posing a substantial barrier to extending the framework or incorporating additional physical models. This lack of flexibility hinders in developing customized solutions for specific applications. Solution method: The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has emerged as a powerful approach for simulating fluid dynamics at the pore-scale due to its simplicity, inherent parallelizability, and ability to handle complex geometries. In this study, we employ the Shan-Chen multiphase LBM framework to model multi-phase and multi-component flow dynamics. Additionally, we incorporate conjugate heat transfer modeling to capture reactive flow behavior and particle deposition in porous medium. A key advantage of our computational framework is its inherent parallelization, which eliminates the need for users to possess specialized parallel programming expertise. The codebase is structured in modular components, each consisting of a few thousand lines of C++ code, leveraging the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to enhance flexibility and maintainability. This design enables users to seamlessly integrate new physics models and modify existing implementations according to their specific research needs. Furthermore, the efficiency of our code is demonstrated through simulations of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems on CPU and GPU architectures. Performance benchmarks are conducted across different CPU and GPU configurations, providing valuable insights for users in selecting the most suitable computational setup for complex flow simulations.

As a result, a more adaptable and cost effective refractive index matched (RIM) medium is created. The transparent nature of the porous medium allows optical systems to visualize the flow field by using poly-amide seeding particles (PSP). Low risk light emitting diode (LED) based light was used to illuminate the plane in order to track the seeding particles’ path for the characterization of the flow inside the porous medium. The system was calibrated using a manually measured flow by a flow meter. Velocity profiles were obtained and analysed qualitatively and quantitatively in order to characterise the flow. Results show that this adaptable, low risk experimental set-up can be used for flow measurements in porous medium under low Reynolds numbers.

Yet, while porous media such as living tissues, geological substrates, or industrial systems typically display a porosity that spans multiple scales, most microfluidic models to date are limited to a single porosity or a small range of pore sizes. Here, a novel microfluidic system with multiscale porosity is presented. By embedding polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogel structures through in-situ photopolymerization in a landscape of microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pillars with varying spacing, micromodels with porosity spanning several orders of magnitude, from nanometers to millimeters are created. Experiments conducted at different porosity patterns demonstrate the potential of this approach to characterize fundamental and ubiquitous biological and geochemical transport processes in porous media. Accounting for multiscale porosity allows studies of the resulting heterogeneous fluid flow and concentration fields of transported chemicals, as well as the biological behaviors associated with this heterogeneity, such as bacterial chemotaxis. This approach brings laboratory studies of transport in porous media a step closer to their natural counterparts in the environment, industry, and medicine.},

	abstract = {Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a dominant material in the fabrication of microfluidic devices to generate water-in-oil droplets, particularly lipid-stabilized droplets, because of its highly hydrophobic nature. However, its key property of hydrophobicity has hindered its use in the microfluidic generation of oil-in-water droplets, which requires channels to have hydrophilic surface properties. In this article, we developed, optimized, and characterized a method to produce PDMS with a hydrophilic surface via the deposition of polyvinyl alcohol following plasma treatment and demonstrated its suitability for droplet generation. The proposed method is simple, quick, effective, and low cost and is versatile with respect to surfactants, with droplets being successfully generated using both anionic surfactants and more biologically relevant phospholipids. This method also allows the device to be selectively patterned with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, leading to the generation of double emulsions and inverted double emulsions.},

They provide a transparent interconnected porous network that enables the optical visualization of the complex fluid flow occurring inside at the pore scale. In this Review, the materials and fabrication methods to make micromodels, the main research activities that are conducted with micromodels and their applications in petroleum, geologic, and environmental engineering, as well as in the food and wood industries, are discussed.

Haines jumps affect global displacement patterns in porous media, promote fingered invasion, increase fluid trapping, and contribute to hysteretic saturation. Detailed analyses and experimental results show that jumps take place when the pressure-volume response is multivalued across the pore throat, during either advancing or receding tests. This situation emerges in “soft systems” such as liquids with entrapped gas bubbles, compliant substrates, and when multiple menisci interact across the porous networks. Elastic deformations and capillarity combine to form the dimensionless elastocapillary number 𝑁ec for a given pore geometry and fluid mixture: a system with elastocapillary number 𝑁ec{\textless}1 is prone to Haines instabilities. Therefore, Haines jumps are more likely to occur not only in soft porous systems, but also when the network topology is characterized by pronounced pore constrictions, and the fluids form small contact angles and generate high interfacial tension.},

Surfactants alter interfacial tension and modify the invasion of pores by immiscible fluids. Experiments are conducted to explore the propagation of fluid interfaces along cylindrical capillary tubes and across pore constrictions in the presence of surfactants. Measured pressure signatures reflect the interaction between surface tension, contact angle, and the pore geometry. Various instabilities occur as the interface traverses the pore constriction, consequently, measured pressure signatures differ from theoretical trends predicted from geometry, lower capillary pressures are generated in advancing wetting fronts, and jumps are prone to under-sampling. Contact angle and instabilities are responsible for pronounced differences between pressure signatures recorded during advancing and receding tests. Pressure signatures gathered with surfactant solutions suggest changes in interfacial tension at the constriction; the transient surface tension is significantly lower than the value measured in quasi-static conditions. Interface stiffening is observed during receding fronts for solutions near the critical micelle concentration. Wetting liquids tend to form plugs at pore constrictions after the invasion of a nonwetting fluid; plugs split the nonwetting fluid into isolated globules and add resistance against fluid flow.},

	abstract = {Injection of CO2 deep underground into porous rocks, such as saline aquifers, appears to be a promising tool for reducing CO2 emissions and the consequent climate change. During this process CO2 displaces brine from individual pores and the sequence in which this happens determines the efficiency with which the rock is filled with CO2 at the large scale. At the pore scale, displacements are controlled by the balance of capillary, viscous and inertial forces. We simulate this process by a numerical technique, multi-GPU Lattice Boltzmann, using X-ray images of the rock pores. The simulations show the three types of fluid displacement patterns, at the larger scale, that have been previously observed in both experiments and simulations: viscous fingering, capillary fingering and stable displacement. Here we examine the impact of the patterns on storage efficiency and then focus on slow flows, where displacements at the pore scale typically happen by sudden jumps in the position of the interface between brine and CO2, Haines jumps. During these jumps, the fluid in surrounding pores can rearrange in a way that prevent later displacements in nearby pores, potentially reducing the efficiency with which the CO2 fills the total available volume in the rock.},

Quasi-static displacements of one immiscible fluid by another in a single pore can lead to interface jumps, pinning and capillary hysteresis, depending on the pore dimensions. It is expected that there is a critical pore configuration for which the interface becomes unstable and an interface jump is triggered. These processes are at the origin of hysteresis in porous media and control macroscopic two-phase fluid displacements.
Experiments and theory
We conduct quasi-static imbibition and drainage experiments and detailed numerical simulations in three and two-dimensional pores, represented by capillaries of different radii that are joined by a conical section (ink-bottle). A theoretical model for the interface is derived based on pressure balance that captures the full spectrum of possible interface behaviors.
Findings
Depending on the slope of the conical section, we observe a range of interfacial behaviors, including capillary jumps and interface pinning during both imbibition and drainage, which give rise to capillary hysteresis, that is, history dependence of the interface position. We identify a critical pore configuration for the occurrence of interface jumps and hysteresis, which depends on surface tension and contact angle.},

	abstract = {Direct numerical simulations are presented for a porous media model consisting of two immiscible fluids, an invading and defending phase, in a two-dimensional micro-geometry filled with randomly sized and randomly distributed cylinders. First, interface instability and penetration modes are studied when varying the wetting features of a single pore in the porous medium. It is found that the displacement patterns not only change with the capillary number, as previously observed, but also are a function of the contact angle, even for a viscosity ratio of unity. This is an important conclusion suggesting that capillary number and viscosity ratio alone cannot completely describe the pore-scale displacement. Second, rapid pore-scale displacement is considered, where the displacements are accompanied by sudden interface jumps from one site to another, known as Haines jumps. The characteristic time and length scales of a Haines jump are examined to better understand the transient dynamics of the jump. We then focus on analyzing the Haines jump in a simple pore configuration where cylinders of equal size are placed at the vertices of equilateral triangles. We use this geometry to provide more insight into the effect of the contact angle at which the Haines jump is predicted.},

We observe a distinct gas invasion pattern, where gas progresses through the pore space in the form of disconnected clusters mediated by double and multiple displacement events. Gas advances in a process we name three-phase Haines jumps, during which gas re-arranges its configuration in the pore space, retracting from some regions to enable the rapid filling of multiple pores. The gas retraction leads to a permanent disconnection of gas ganglia, which do not reconnect as gas injection proceeds. We observe, in situ, the direct displacement of oil and water by gas as well as gas–oil–water double displacement. The use of local in situ measurements and an energy balance approach to determine fluid–fluid contact angles alongside the quantification of capillary pressures and pore occupancy indicate that the wettability order is oil–gas–water from most to least wetting. Furthermore, quantifying the evolution of Minkowski functionals implied well-connected oil and water, while the gas connectivity decreased as gas was broken up into discrete clusters during injection. This work can be used to design CO2 storage, improved oil recovery and microfluidic devices.},

However, what is less understood and where experimental data are lacking is direct knowledge of the dynamics of pore drainage and the associated intrinsic time scales since the rate dependencies often observed with displacement processes are potentially dependent on these time scales. Herein, we study pore drainage events with a high speed camera in a micromodel system and analyze the dependency of interfacial velocity on bulk flow rate and spatial fluid configurations. We find that pore drainage events are cooperative, meaning that capillary pressure differences which extend over multiple pores directly affect fluid topology and menisci dynamics. Results suggest that not only viscous forces but also capillarity acts in a nonlocal way. Lastly, the existence of a pore morphological parameter where pore drainage transitions from capillary to inertial and/or viscous dominated is discussed followed by a discussion on capillary dispersion and time scale dependencies. We show that the displacement front is disperse when volumetric flow rate is less than the intrinsic time scale for a pore drainage event and becomes sharp when the flow rate is greater than the intrinsic time scale (i.e., overruns the pore drainage event), which clearly shows how pore-scale parameters influence macroscale flow behavior.},

X-ray microtomography is employed to generate three-dimensional fluid occupancy maps within a rough-walled fracture and its neighboring rock matrix during drainage and imbibition flow experiments. Several different imbibition flow conditions were created by changing brine flow rate, fracture aperture field, and interfacial tension between the fluids. These maps along with steady-state pressure drop data are then used to shed light on the dominant flow mechanisms and preferential flow paths through the matrix and fracture domains as well as fluid transfer between them during the imbibition processes. Depending on the fracture aperture properties and the magnitude of the local capillary pressures that are established under varying flow conditions, transport of the wetting phase across the hybrid matrix-fracture medium is governed by flow through wetting layers of brine on fracture walls (fracture layer flow), center of the fracture (fracture bulk flow), and brine-filled pores within the matrix. The hydraulic conductivity through these conduits is regulated by the medium as it identifies a combined flow path with minimum pressure drop from the inlet to the outlet of the system. The resulting balance determines the magnitude of fluid transfer experienced by the neighboring matrix and ultimate oil recovery as a result.},

	abstract = {We perform a numerical and experimental study of immiscible two-phase flows within predominantly 2D transparent PDMS microfluidic domains with disordered pillar-like obstacles, that effectively serve as artificial porous structures. Using a high sensitivity pressure sensor at the flow inlet, we capture experimentally the pressure dynamics under fixed flow rate conditions as the fluid–fluid interface advances within the porous domain, while also monitoring the corresponding phase distribution patterns using optical microscopy. Our experimental study covers 4 orders of magnitude with respect to the injection flow rate and highlights the characteristics of immiscible displacement processes during the transition from the capillarity-controlled interface displacement regime at lower flow rates, where the pores are invaded sequentially in the form of Haines jumps, to the viscosity-dominated regime, where multiple pores are invaded simultaneously. In the capillary regime, we recover a clear correlation between the recorded inlet pressure and the pore-throat diameter invaded by the interface that follows the Young–Laplace equation, while during the transition to the viscous regime such a correlation is no longer evident due to multiple pore-throats being invaded simultaneously (but also due to significant viscous pressure drop along the inlet and outlet channels, that effectively mask capillary effects). The performed experimental study serves for the validation of a robust Level-Set model capable of explicitly tracking interfacial dynamics at sub-pore scale resolutions under identical flow conditions. The numerical model is validated against both well-established theoretical flow models, that account for the effects of viscous and capillary forces on interfacial dynamics, and the experimental results obtained using the developed microfluidic setup over a wide range of capillary numbers. Our results show that the proposed numerical model recovers very well the experimentally observed flow dynamics in terms of phase distribution patterns and inlet pressures, but also the effects of viscous flow on the apparent (i.e. dynamic) contact angles in the vicinity of the pore walls. For the first time in the literature, this work clearly shows that the proposed numerical approach has an undoubtable strong potential to simulate multiphase flow in porous domains over a wide range of Capillary numbers.},

	abstract = {Slow multiphase flow in porous media is intriguing because its underlying dynamics is almost deterministic, yet depends on a hierarchy of spatiotemporal processes. There has been great progress in the experimental study of such multiphase flows, but three-dimensional (3D) microscopy methods probing the pore-scale fluid dynamics with millisecond resolution have been lacking. Yet, it is precisely at these length and time scales that the crucial pore-filling events known as Haines jumps take place. Here, we report four-dimensional (4D) (3D + time) observations of multiphase flow in a consolidated porous medium as captured in situ by stroboscopic X-ray micro-tomography. With a total duration of 6.5 s and 2 kHz frame rate, our experiments provide unprecedented access to the multiscale liquid dynamics. Our tomography strategy relies on the fact that Haines jumps, although irregularly spaced in time, are almost deterministic, and therefore repeatable during imbibition-drainage cycling. We studied the time-dependent flow pattern in a porous medium consisting of sintered glass shards. Exploiting the repeatability, we could combine the radiographic projections recorded under different angles during successive cycles into a 3D movie, allowing us to reconstruct pore-scale events, such as Haines jumps, with a spatiotemporal resolution that is two orders of magnitude higher than was hitherto possible. This high resolution allows us to explore the detailed interfacial dynamics during drainage, including fluid-front displacements and velocities. Our experimental approach opens the way to the study of fast, yet deterministic mesoscopic processes also other than flow in porous media.},

	abstract = {Haines jumps and meniscus reconfiguration are commonly observed in immiscible two-phase flows through porous media. The experiment found that the fluid-fluid interface moves rapidly during these two phenomena. This leads to hydraulic change and entropy production events, which have important implications for relative permeability of two-phase flow in porous media. However, owing to the energy-transfer process remains to be elucidated, their impact on transport of heat and mass in porous media has not yet been well predicted. By analyzing the exchange process between surface energy, kinetic energy, and viscous dissipation, this study provides a better understanding of meniscus dynamics and whether these effects are significant on a larger scale. In this study, Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) combined with level-set method was used to simulate the process of Haines jumps and meniscus reconfiguration. A governing equation combined with density-scale continuum surface force (CSF) model was derived for energy conservation, and simulations were performed considering high-density and high-viscosity ratios. The rate of surface-energy change was evaluated using CSF model. A capillary tube was designed to verify the rate of surface-energy change in simulation. Comparison of simulation and theoretical data indicates that the density-scale CSF model can satisfactorily evaluate the rate of change in surface energy. Besides, to compare energy transfer process in Haines jumps and meniscus reconfiguration, two simulation cases were designed: (I) Haines jump and meniscus reconfiguration occur individually, and (II) Haines jump and meniscus reconfiguration occur simultaneously. We investigated the energy exchange process and compared the effects of the inertial force and viscous dissipation between cases I and II. Based on the simulation results, the interface releases surface free energy to the system during the Haines jumps and meniscus reconfiguration. In the case of only Haines jumps, a portion of the released surface energy is absorbed by another fluid-fluid interface, thus reducing the surface-energy release rate in the system. This energy can be dissipated promptly, resulting in a rapid viscous-dissipation growth; but the kinetic-energy change is negligible. However, when meniscus reconfiguration occurs, released surface energy is difficult to reabsorb and cannot dissipate quickly. Thus, a significant amount of released energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is subsequently damped by the fluid. This significant kinetic-energy oscillation generates a large inertial force and spreads over a wider sphere of influence in the porous media. Energy transfer process shows a more detailed fundamental understanding of mass transfer in porous media, such as flow perturbations, entropy production and permeability in porous media, and it helps a rigorous process for upscaling models used for thermodynamic, heat and mass transfer in porous media.},

	abstract = {Relative permeability and capillary pressure are the governing parameters that characterize multiphase fluid flow in porous media for diverse natural and industrial applications, including surface water infiltration into the ground, CO2 sequestration, and hydrocarbon enhanced recovery. Although the drastic effects of deformation of porous media on single-phase fluid flow have been well established, the stress dependency of flow in multiphase systems is not yet fully explored. Here, stress-dependent relative permeability and capillary pressure are studied in a water-wet carbonate specimen both analytically using fractal and poroelasticity theory and experimentally on the micro-scale and macro-scales by means of X-ray computed micro-tomography and isothermal isotropic triaxial core flooding cell, respectively. Our core flooding program using water/N2 phases shows a systematic decrease in the irreducible water saturation and gas relative permeability in response to an increase in effective stress. Intuitively, a leftward shift of the intersection point of water/gas relative permeability curves is interpreted as an increased affinity of the rock to the gas phase. Using a micro-scale proxy model, we identify a leftward shift in pore size distribution and closure of micro-channels to be responsible for the abovementioned observations. These findings prove the crucial impact of effective stress-induced pore deformation on multiphase flow properties of rock, which are missing from the current characterizations of multiphase flow mechanisms in porous media.},

	abstract = {A significant amount of theoretical, numerical and observational work has been published focused on various aspects of capillary trapping in CO2 storage since the IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (2005). This research has placed capillary trapping in a central role in nearly every aspect of the geologic storage of CO2. Capillary, or residual, trapping – where CO2 is rendered immobile in the pore space as disconnected ganglia, surrounded by brine in a storage aquifer – is controlled by fluid and interfacial physics at the size scale of rock pores. These processes have been observed at the pore scale in situ using X-ray microtomography at reservoir conditions. A large database of conventional centimetre core scale observations for flow modelling are now available for a range of rock types and reservoir conditions. These along with the pore scale observations confirm that trapped saturations will be at least 10\% and more typically 30\% of the pore volume of the rock, stable against subsequent displacement by brine and characteristic of water-wet systems. Capillary trapping is pervasive over the extent of a migrating CO2 plume and both theoretical and numerical investigations have demonstrated the first order impacts of capillary trapping on plume migration, immobilisation and CO2 storage security. Engineering strategies to maximise capillary trapping have been proposed that make use of injection schemes that maximise sweep or enhance imbibition. National assessments of CO2 storage capacity now incorporate modelling of residual trapping where it can account for up to 95\% of the storage resource. Field scale observations of capillary trapping have confirmed the formation and stability of residually trapped CO2 at masses up to 10,000tons and over time scales of years. Significant outstanding uncertainties include the impact of heterogeneity on capillary immobilisation and capillary trapping in mixed-wet systems. Overall capillary trapping is well constrained by laboratory and field scale observations, effectively modelled in theoretical and numerical models and significantly enhances storage integrity, both increasing storage capacity and limiting the rate and extent of plume migration.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen (H2) is a promising clean fuel that could replace fossil fuels for the actualization of the net zero carbon energy transition. Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) in sandstone formations is an essential component of the hydrogen economy value chain for achieving large-scale H2 storage. In this study, snap-off effects and impacts of high hydrogen residual trapping on the viability of UHS in a Gosford sandstone formation were assessed from initial and residual H2 saturations in the miniature core plugs. The flooded cores were imaged with X-ray microcomputed tomography (μCT) to identify the fluid (brine and H2) distributions in the pore spaces. Results showed the presence of large interconnected stable H2 clusters after the drainage process, with an initial H2 saturation of almost 53\%, suggesting that hydrogen will occupy more than half of the pore volume during storage. However, several disconnected H2 ganglia and the snapped-off of H2 droplets from the pore throats were noticed after the imbibition stage with almost 44\% residual H2 saturations. Such highly residually trapped H2 in the strongly water-wet Gosford sandstone will be difficult to mobilize, resulting in the possible withdrawal of just 9\% stored H2. The study suggests that the water-wet system could produce high H2 residual saturations, which is unfavorable for hydrogen withdrawal and extraction at the peak energy demand period due to disconnection and trapping of the nonwetting phase.},

We define three key designs of such hydrogel devices, having linear, T-shaped, and branched channels and report results of numerical simulation of the process of their infusion with solute carried by the incoming fluid. The computational procedure takes into account both pressure-driven convection and concentration gradient-driven diffusion in the permeable gel matrix.

The T-shaped channel network was identified as the most efficient one and was improved further by investigating the effect of the channel-end secondary branches.

However, currently used microfabrication methods of constructing microfluidic devices are not suitable for the handling of hydrogel. This study presents a novel method of fabricating hydrogel-based microfluidic chips by combining the casting and bonding processes. A twice cross-linking strategy is designed to obtain a bonding interface that has the same strength with the hydrogel bulk, which can be applied to arbitrary combinations of hydrogels. It is convenient to achieve the construction of hydrogel structures with channels in branched, spiral, serpentine, and multilayer forms. The experimental results show that the combination of gelatin and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) owns the best biocompatibility and can promote cell functionalization. Based on these, a vessel-on-a-chip system with vascular function in both physiological and pathological situations is established, providing a promising model for further investigations such as vascularization, vascular inflammation, tissue engineering, and drug development. Taken together, a facile and cytocompatible approach is developed for engineering a user-defined hydrogel-based chip that can be potentially useful in developing vascularized tissue or organ models.},

The developed framework incorporates advanced numerical methods and algorithms to accurately capture complex fluid dynamics and phase interactions. It offers a wide range of capabilities, including phase separation, interfacial tension, and mass transfer phenomena. The reactive interface simulation module enables the study of chemical reactions occurring at the fluid-fluid interface, expanding its applicability to reactive multi-phase systems. The performance and accuracy of CooLBM are demonstrated through various benchmark simulations, showcasing its ability to capture intricate fluid behaviors and interface dynamics. The modular structure of the code allows for easy customization and extension, facilitating the implementation of additional models and boundary conditions. Finally, CooLBM provides visualization tools for the analysis and interpretation of simulation results. Overall, CooLBM offers an efficient computational framework for studying complex multi-phase systems and reactive interfaces, making it a valuable tool for researchers and engineers in several fields including, but not limited to chemical engineering, materials science, and environmental engineering.

	abstract = {This study evaluates the oil recovery potential of sandstone reservoirs through sequential water-alternating CO₂ gas injection. Experimental work focuses on optimizing injection patterns, including alternating CO₂ and water cycles, to assess their impact on enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Analytical methods performed before detailed analyses include Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) on the crude oil and core samples from the same field of Cambay Basin. FTIR analysis revealed a dominance of long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, suggesting favorable interactions with CO₂ for viscosity reduction and oil swelling. XRD revealed quartz-dominant cores with subordinate feldspar that control fluid permeability and chemical interactiveness. Sequential Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG) injection improved sweep efficiency by minimizing gas channeling and maximizing CO₂-oil contact. Soak periods conducted during injection enhance some miscibility effects with addition of extra oil mobility. High permeability cores experienced early gas breakthroughs, while low permeability delayed gas movement, achieving better recovery. Reservoir heterogeneities and water-shielding effects were critical challenges, underscoring the role of petrophysical properties in recovery performance. The results demonstrate that CO₂ WAG injection in sandstone reservoirs significantly enhances crude oil recovery by improving oil displacement efficiency. The presented work emphasizes the parameters porosity, permeability, and oil saturation as prerequisites for the process. Collected sandstone core samples show that variations in these properties influence the effectiveness of CO₂ WAG injection showing the resultant oil recovery increase by 20–25\% after secondary brine injection. The integration of advanced characterization and strategic injection patterns establishes a foundation for optimizing CO2 EOR in mature fields.},

	abstract = {The permeability of a pore structure is typically described by stochastic representations of its geometrical attributes (e.g. pore-size distribution, porosity, coordination number). Database-driven numerical solvers for large model domains can only accurately predict large-scale flow behavior when they incorporate upscaled descriptions of that structure. The upscaling is particularly challenging for rocks with multimodal porosity structures such as carbonates, where several different type of structures (e.g. micro-porosity, cavities, fractures) are interacting. It is the connectivity both within and between these fundamentally different structures that ultimately controls the porosity–permeability relationship at the larger length scales. Recent advances in machine learning techniques combined with both numerical modelling and informed structural analysis have allowed us to probe the relationship between structure and permeability much more deeply. We have used this integrated approach to tackle the challenge of upscaling multimodal and multiscale porous media. We present a novel method for upscaling multimodal porosity–permeability relationships using machine learning based multivariate structural regression. A micro-CT image of Estaillades limestone was divided into small 603 and 1203 sub-volumes and permeability was computed using the Darcy–Brinkman–Stokes (DBS) model. The microporosity–porosity–permeability relationship from Menke et al. (Earth Arxiv, https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/ubg6p, 2019) was used to assign permeability values to the cells containing microporosity. Structural attributes (porosity, phase connectivity, volume fraction, etc.) of each sub-volume were extracted using image analysis tools and then regressed against the solved DBS permeability using an Extra-Trees regression model to derive an upscaled porosity–permeability relationship. Ten test cases of 3603 voxels were then modeled using Darcy-scale flow with this machine learning predicted upscaled porosity–permeability relationship and benchmarked against full DBS simulations, a numerically upscaled Darcy flow model, and a Kozeny–Carman model. All numerical simulations were performed using GeoChemFoam, our in-house open source pore-scale simulator based on OpenFOAM. We found good agreement between the full DBS simulations and both the numerical and machine learning upscaled models, with the machine learning model being 80 times less computationally expensive. The Kozeny–Carman model was a poor predictor of upscaled permeability in all cases.},

This paper presents and attempts to solve subsurface flow problem using neural upscaling method. The neural upscaling method, described in the present work, is a machine learning approach to calculate effective properties in each grid block for subsurface flow modeling. This method is intended to be more accurate than traditional analytical upscaling methods (which are only accurate for layered or homogeneous media) and numerical upscaling methods (which are more accurate for heterogeneous media but involve higher computational cost and are dependent on boundary conditions). The neural upscaling method is based on learning from a large number of geological realizations, which allows it to account for uncertainty in geology. It is also computationally fast and accurate. The method is demonstrated through a series of 2D test cases, and its accuracy is compared to that of analytical and numerical upscaling methods.},

	abstract = {Successful deployment of geological carbon storage (GCS) requires an extensive use of reservoir simulators for screening, ranking and optimization of storage sites. However, the time scales of GCS are such that no sufficient long-term data is available yet to validate the simulators against. As a consequence, there is currently no solid basis for assessing the quality with which the dynamics of large-scale GCS operations can be forecasted. To meet this knowledge gap, we have conducted a major GCS validation benchmark study. To achieve reasonable time scales, a laboratory-size geological storage formation was constructed (the “FluidFlower”), forming the basis for both the experimental and computational work. A validation experiment consisting of repeated GCS operations was conducted in the FluidFlower, providing what we define as the true physical dynamics for this system. Nine different research groups from around the world provided forecasts, both individually and collaboratively, based on a detailed physical and petrophysical characterization of the FluidFlower sands. The major contribution of this paper is a report and discussion of the results of the validation benchmark study, complemented by a description of the benchmarking process and the participating computational models. The forecasts from the participating groups are compared to each other and to the experimental data by means of various indicative qualitative and quantitative measures. By this, we provide a detailed assessment of the capabilities of reservoir simulators and their users to capture both the injection and post-injection dynamics of the GCS operations.},

	abstract = {We present a new pore-scale model for multicomponent advective-diffusive transport with coupled mineral dissolution and precipitation. Both dissolution and precipitation are captured simultaneously by introducing a phase transformation vector field representing the direction and magnitude of the overall phase change. An effective viscosity model is adopted in simulating fluid flow during mineral dissolution-precipitation that can accurately capture the velocity field without introducing any empirical parameters. The proposed approach is validated against analytical solutions and interface tracking simulations in simplified structures. After validation, the proposed approach is employed in modeling realistic rocks where mineral dissolution and precipitation are dominant at different locations. We have identified three regimes for mineral dissolution-precipitation coupling: (a) compact dissolution-precipitation where dissolution is dominant near the inlet and precipitation is dominant near the outlet, (b) wormhole dissolution with clustered precipitation where dissolution generates wormholes in the main flow paths and precipitation clogs the secondary flow paths, and (c) dissolution dominant where all solid grains are gradually dissolved. In the three regimes, the proposed approach provides reliable porosity-permeability relationships that cannot be described well by traditional macroscale models. We find that the permeability can increase while the overall porosity decreases when the main flow paths are expanded by dissolution and adjacent pore spaces are clogged by precipitation.},

	abstract = {The promise of biomass-derived biofuels is often overshadowed by intricate material handling challenges such as hopper clogging and screw feeder jamming. These handling issues stem from the knowledge gap among particle-scale material properties (e.g., particle size), bulk-scale material attributes (e.g., relative density), macro-scale equipment design (e.g., hopper inclination), and flow performance (e.g., probability of clogging). This work combines physical experiments, validated numerical simulations, and data augmentation to develop a machine learning-based hopper design for flowing granular woody biomass materials. The flow behavior of granular biomass is simulated and validated against physical tests utilizing the developed smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) solver and a modified hypoplastic model. A comprehensive evaluation of the flow performance, including flow rate, flow stability, and flow pattern, is conducted on an extensive data set encompassing various biomass particle sizes, moisture contents, relative densities, and hopper operating conditions. A feed-forward neural network is trained and optimized with this data set to correlate cross-scale attributes with the flow performance metrics. The results reveal promising predictive accuracy on seen and unseen data sets. Further evaluation of how various input attributes affect the predicted flow performance metrics is carried out. The results indicate that hopper opening width primarily dictates flow throughput, while relative density, wall friction, inclination angle, and hopper opening width collectively impact flow stability. Additionally, flow patterns are predominantly governed by relative density, wall friction, and inclination angle. Moreover, the clogging potential is found to be exclusively characterized by the index dedicated to flow stability. The combination of high moisture contents, dense packing, smooth wall friction, low inclination angles, and small hopper opening widths substantially elevates the risk of unstable flows and clogging. This study serves as a potent design tool for flowing milled woody biomass materials in hoppers for all stakeholders in biorefineries and equipment manufacturing.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen-based technologies present a promising solution for the global energy transition. In addition to electrolytic production, subsurface geological formations provide a potential natural source of hydrogen. Iron-rich ultramafic rocks, in particular, are favorable for hydrogen generation through natural processes such as serpentinization. Naturally occurring reactions and migration can be enhanced through various types of stimulation, including thermal, hydraulic, and chemical treatment. Through numerical simulations, we analyzed the complex interplay of factors influencing the production and migration within the subsurface, emphasizing the importance of different stimulation techniques, catalysts, and conditions. Our findings indicate that key parameters, such as damage zone permeability and width, significantly impact producible hydrogen mass. Our results indicate that a combination of large damage zone widths, high permeability, and a stimulated reaction rate of 1 × 10-9 can yield economically viable production rates of up to 1kgs-1 at the wellhead. Moreover, the availability of ferrous iron, rather than the serpentinization rate itself, has been identified as the primary limiting factor in achieving economically sustainable hydrogen production. While an unstimulated rock volume of 0.165km3 yields only 45t of hydrogen in two years, various stimulation techniques can increase production to 18500t.},
