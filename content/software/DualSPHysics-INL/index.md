summary: An example event.
abstract: DualSPHysics-INL is an extended adaptation of the DualSPHysics open-source Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation software based on DualSPHysics release version 5.0.1. Source code was modified from src_mphase/DSPH_v5.0_NNewtonian.  While DualSPHysics was developed for the simulation of fluid flow, DualSPHysics-INL was developed to simulate the flow of granular materials, such as soils and biomass feedstocks. In DualSPHysics-INL, a critical state soil mechanics based G-B hypoplastic constitutive model (Gudehus & Bauer) was adopted that has the capability to simulate granular materials of a wide range of mechanical responses. The code adopts a momentum-based boundary condition that is able to sustain impact loading without particles leaking to the outside of the boundaries and can achieve a full range of frictional conditions, including free-slip and no-slip. The code adopts GPU-acceleration, enabling fast computation for complex problems. The following examples provide a glance of applications that the DualSPHysics-INL can simulate!

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including page elements such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
