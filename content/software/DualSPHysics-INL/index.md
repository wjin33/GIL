abstract: In situ gas extraction is the main measure adopted by mines to achieve mining
  safety standards. Coal permeability is significantly influenced by coal shrinkage
  during gas release. Based on effective stress and additional damage that resulted
  from gas extraction, a unique model was proposed to describe the spatial and temporal
  distribution of coal permeability within the effective influence zone. Calculation
  models for the conditions of one and two extracting boreholes were developed. A
  parametric study on both two models was also conducted, in which the effect of extraction
  time, extraction pressure, interval between two boreholes, and extraction pressure
  combination were qualitatively analyzed. The results demonstrated that with the
  increase of extraction time, gas extraction can result in less permeability reduction
  in the beginning but can enhance permeability. Coal permeability obviously increases
  when extraction time increases but gradually stabilizes, presenting “high middle
  and low around” surrounding the extracting borehole. Meanwhile, a decreasing relative
  amplification implies that permeability ratio does not increase linearly with the
  increase in extraction pressure. Both intervals between two extracting boreholes
  and different combinations of extraction pressure significantly influence the distribution
  of coal permeability. A comparison with some previous permeability studies was conducted
  to validate the proposed model, and the predicted evolution results matched the
  permeability testing data. In conclusion, the proposed model is consistent with
  the phenomenon in real engineering, and the model results can provide preliminary
  guidance for the design of extracting borehole distribution.
