summary: This MATLAB package simulates fluid-driven fracture propagation in porous, anisotropic materials across multiple scales. It combines a meso-scale nonlocal damage model, a macro-scale cohesive zone model, and a transition algorithm to capture multiscale mechanical behavior. Fluid flow in both the matrix and fractures is modeled using Darcyâ€™s and Cubic laws, and XFEM is employed for discretization and solution of the boundary value problems.

# abstract: This software built on the open-source, parallel (Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment) framework, using the finite-element method. It solves the momentum balance and mass conservation equations for hydraulic fracturing using numerical techniques such as the discontinuous Galerkin method, cohesive zone models, and multiphase, multicomponent fluid-flow simulations. This allows the software to simulate proppant-fluid mixture-driven fracture propagation, proppant transport and settling, and fracture closure with proppant compaction. ELK solves the coupled dynamic hydromechanical governing equations for electric shocking (i.e., pulsed-power-induced fracturing). A damage model and permeability and stiffness evolution constitutive laws have been incorporated to simulate multi-fracture propagation in saturated environments.
