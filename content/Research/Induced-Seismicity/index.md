It is well known that fluid injection (e.g., COâ‚‚ sequestration, waterflooding, or subsurface stimulation) can induce seismic events. The mechanisms for injection-time seismicity are relatively well established, typically attributed to either effective stress reduction due to elevated pore pressure or increased total stress that reactivates pre-existing fractures. However, a significant portion of induced seismic events, particularly those with larger magnitudes, occur after injection has ceased. The mechanisms driving these post-injection events remain poorly understood. Our laboratory is actively investigating this knowledge gap using advanced numerical modeling tools.
