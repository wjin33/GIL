Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized the oil and gas industry, yet, its quasi-static process constrain the fracture propagation direction from the minimum in situ stress direction. For applications in in-situ mining, geothermal extration, geological hydrogen stimulation, novel fracturing technology, such as pulsed power fracturing, needs to empolyed to mitigate short circulting, increase the permeability, and increase the geochemical reaciton surface with several orders of magnitude. GIL has been working on this area by developing advnaced numerical tools to model the poro-dynamic fracturing process.
