Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized the oil and gas industry, and decades of field practice have enabled a deep understanding of many aspects of the process. However, several key phenomena remain insufficiently addressed:
1. The conventional mode-I fracture propagation mechanism does not explain the observed generation of fracture swarms;
2. Modeling of fracture growth coupled with proppant transport and settlement requires significant improvement;
3. Fracture closure during shut-in and flowback periods—and the resulting residual fracture aperture—are still not well characterized.

Beyond the inherent complexity of these multiphysics processes, achieving high-fidelity modeling of hydraulic fracturing demands extensive computational resources. Our group is developing advanced computational tools, incorporating refined physical mechanisms and GPU-accelerated simulations, to tackle these challenges.
