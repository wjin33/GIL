title: Multiscale modeling of micro-crack initiation to macro-fracture propagation

Brittle materials—such as concrete, rock, and ceramic composites—exhibit complex mechanical behavior at the meso-scale, including:
- Stress-induced damage and stiffness anisotropy,
- Nonlinear stress–strain relationships,
- Volumetric dilation caused by irreversible strain,
- Unilateral effects due to crack closure,
- A brittle-to-ductile transition under increasing confining stress,
- Distinct mechanical responses in tension and compression.

Physically, these effects arise from the nucleation and propagation of microcracks at grain boundaries and cross pore spaces. The growth and coalescence of these diffuse microcracks lead to the formation of localized macro-fractures and ultimately to structural failure. Accurately modeling this cross-scale process has been a long-standing challenge. The goal of this project is to:

- Formulate constitutive damage models that captures these behaviors using physically meaningful and identifiable material parameters,
- Develop algorithms and a theoretical framework to model the transition from microcrack evolution to macro-fracture formation,
- Implement the constitutive and cohesive fracture models within finite element codes using appropriate discretization techniques,
- Apply the computational framework to perform complete failure analyses of materials such as concrete, granite, and shale.
