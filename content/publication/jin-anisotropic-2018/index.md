abstract: This paper presents the theoretical formulation and numerical implementation
  of an anisotropic damage model for materials with intrinsic transverse isotropy.
  Crack initiation and propagation are modeled by phenomenological damage evolution
  laws, controlled by four equivalent strain measures. The latter are constructed
  so as to distinguish the mechanical response of the material in tension and compression,
  along the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane and within the bedding plane.
  To avoid mesh dependency induced by softening, equivalent strains are replaced by
  nonlocal counterparts, defined as weighted averages over a neighborhood scaled by
  two internal length parameters. Finite Element equations are solved with a normal
  plane arc length control algorithm, which allows passing limit points in case of
  snap back or snap through. The model is calibrated against triaxial compression
  tests performed on shale, for different confinements and loading orientations relative
  to the bedding plane. Gauss point simulations confirm that the model successfully
  captures the variation of uniaxial tensile strength with respect to the bedding
  orientation. Finite Element simulations of three-point bending tests and compression
  splitting tests show that nonlocal enhancement indeed avoids mesh dependency, and
  that the axial and transverse dimensions of the damage process zone are scaled by
  the two characteristic lengths. Results further show that the damage process zone
  is direction dependent both in tension and compression. The model can be used for
  any type of textured brittle material; it allows representing several concurrent
  damage mechanisms in the macroscopic response and interpreting the failure mechanisms
  that control the damage process zone.
