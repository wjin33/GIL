abstract: The commercialization of bioenergy has been significantly limited by various
  material handling issues due to the poor flowability of granular biomass materials.
  Addressing these issues demands a fundamental understanding of flow physics and
  robust models to predict the multi-regime flow behavior of biomass particles. In
  this study, we investigated the multi-regime flow behavior of loblolly pine chips,
  a widely used bioenergy feedstock, through combined experiments and simulations.
  A quasi-static hypoplastic model and a cross-regime Drucker–Prager (DP)-μ(I) model
  were utilized and validated against inclined plane flow experiments to understand
  the quasi-static and dense flow behavior of milled pine chips. The results show
  that along the inclined plane, loblolly pine chips mainly present in heap flow (varying
  thickness along the plane), and in plane flow (iso-thickness along the plane) only
  when the inclination closes to the material’s critical state internal friction angle.
  The results also show that the multi-regime DP-μ(I) model predicts a completely
  different velocity profile from the hypoplastic model. DP-μ(I) model can capture
  the flow behavior of pine chips in both flow regimes well but at the cost of extra
  parameter determination, and the shear-rate dependent rheology model can successfully
  capture the flow of elongated high-frictional particles. These findings advance
  the scientific understanding of the multi-regime flow behavior of granular biomass
  materials and shed light on formulating novel constitutive models to assist granular
  biomass handling in the bioenergy industry.
