abstract: Poor flowability of compressible biomass particles poses severe handling
  challenges in all processes of biorefineries, which results in poor energy-yielding
  in conversion. This paper presents the characterization of the flow behavior of
  a widely used compressible biomass material (ground loblolly pine) using a combination
  of physical characterization and numerical simulation. An advanced hypoplastic model
  with implementation and validation in Abaqus VUMAT is adopted. A workflow is established
  to calibrate material parameters directly from index tests, an oedometer test, and
  a Schulze ring shear test, and indirectly from numerical simulations of those tests.
  The finite element simulation of axial shear tests and hopper flow tests using the
  calibrated hypoplastic model is shown to capture key flow attributes, such as the
  maximum shear stress in shear tests, as well as the mass flow rate and flow pattern
  in hopper. The results demonstrate that a subset of the laboratory tests needs to
  allow large strains for adequate characterization of compressible granular flow,
  and numerical models developed for non-compressible materials can accurately predict
  the flow behavior of compressible biomass material, even though strain magnitudes
  are not scaled correctly. This study provides a potent tool to decipher and resolve
  material handling upsets in biorefineries and other energy industries that utilize
  forest products.
