abstract: A computational tool is developed to simulate the propagation of a discrete
  fracture within a continuum damage process zone. Microcrack initiation and propagation
  prior to coalescence are represented by a nonlocal anisotropic Continuum Damage
  Mechanics (CDM) model in which the crack density is calculated explicitly. A damage
  threshold is defined to mark the beginning of crack coalescence. When that threshold
  is reached, a cohesive segment is inserted in the mesh to replace a portion of the
  damage process zone by a segment of discrete fracture. Discretization is done with
  the extended Finite Element Method (XFEM), which makes it possible to simulate fracture
  propagation without assigning the fracture path a priori. Rigorous calibration procedures
  are established for the cohesive strength (related to the damage threshold) and
  for the cohesive energy release rate, to ensure the balance of energy dissipated
  at the micro and macro scales. The XFEM-based tool is implemented into an open source
  object-oriented numerical package (OOFEM), and used to simulate wedge splitting
  and three-point bending tests. Results demonstrate that the proposed numerical method
  captures the entire failure process in mode I, from a mesh-independent diffuse damage
  zone to a localized fracture. Future work will investigate mixed mode fracture propagation.
