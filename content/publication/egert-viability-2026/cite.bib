 abstract = {Hydrogen-based technologies present a promising solution for the global energy transition. In addition to electrolytic production, subsurface geological formations provide a potential natural source of hydrogen. Iron-rich ultramafic rocks, in particular, are favorable for hydrogen generation through natural processes such as serpentinization. Naturally occurring reactions and migration can be enhanced through various types of stimulation, including thermal, hydraulic, and chemical treatment. Through numerical simulations, we analyzed the complex interplay of factors influencing the production and migration within the subsurface, emphasizing the importance of different stimulation techniques, catalysts, and conditions. Our findings indicate that key parameters, such as damage zone permeability and width, significantly impact producible hydrogen mass. Our results indicate that a combination of large damage zone widths, high permeability, and a stimulated reaction rate of 1 Ã— 10-9 can yield economically viable production rates of up to 1kgs-1 at the wellhead. Moreover, the availability of ferrous iron, rather than the serpentinization rate itself, has been identified as the primary limiting factor in achieving economically sustainable hydrogen production. While an unstimulated rock volume of 0.165km3 yields only 45t of hydrogen in two years, various stimulation techniques can increase production to 18500t.},
