abstract: Hydrogen-based technologies present a promising solution for the global
  energy transition. In addition to electrolytic production, subsurface geological
  formations provide a potential natural source of hydrogen. Iron-rich ultramafic
  rocks, in particular, are favorable for hydrogen generation through natural processes
  such as serpentinization. Naturally occurring reactions and migration can be enhanced
  through various types of stimulation, including thermal, hydraulic, and chemical
  treatment. Through numerical simulations, we analyzed the complex interplay of factors
  influencing the production and migration within the subsurface, emphasizing the
  importance of different stimulation techniques, catalysts, and conditions. Our findings
  indicate that key parameters, such as damage zone permeability and width, significantly
  impact producible hydrogen mass. Our results indicate that a combination of large
  damage zone widths, high permeability, and a stimulated reaction rate of 1 Ã— 10-9
  can yield economically viable production rates of up to 1kgs-1 at the wellhead.
  Moreover, the availability of ferrous iron, rather than the serpentinization rate
  itself, has been identified as the primary limiting factor in achieving economically
  sustainable hydrogen production. While an unstimulated rock volume of 0.165km3 yields
  only 45t of hydrogen in two years, various stimulation techniques can increase production
  to 18500t.
