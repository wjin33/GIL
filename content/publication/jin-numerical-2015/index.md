abstract: 'The objective of this work is to model the influence of shear stresses
  induced by viscous fluid flow on wellbore spalling. We simulated a drop of stress
  and pore pressure at the wall of a meter-scale borehole with a plane strain Finite
  Element model. The rock mass was modeled as a jointed continuum. Block sliding was
  predicted from the tangential displacements in the joint after the shear failure
  criterion was reached. Simulations show that: (1) Higher far field stresses induce
  more normal stress in the joints, which prevents the occurrence of shear plastic
  strains in the joints and reduces block sliding at the wall; (2) Shear stresses
  and consequent shear plastic strains that are induced by viscous fluid flow in the
  joints are higher for higher fluid viscosities, and decrease over time as the blocks
  on each side of the joint slide on each other; (3) In joints that are in contact
  with the borehole, a change of one order of magnitude in the fluid viscosity results
  in a change in joint shear stress by a factor of 2. Results suggest that if drainage
  had been simulated over a longer period of time or for a smaller borehole diameter,
  the failure criterion would have been reached on a larger zone around the borehole,
  which could have a critical impact on the risk of borehole spalling. The numerical
  approach proposed in this work is expected to be useful to recommend wellbore operation
  modes so as to avoid excessive spalling and clogging.'
