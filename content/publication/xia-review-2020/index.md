abstract: Biomass is a renewable and sustainable energy resource. Current design of
  biomass handling and feeding equipment leverage both experiments and numerical modeling.
  This paper reviews the state-of-the-art discrete element methods (DEM) for the flow
  of milled biomass (Part I), accompanied by a comprehensive review on continuum-based
  computational models (Part II). The present review on DEM is primarily focused on
  the features and suitability of various particle shape models for different types
  of milled biomass because particle shape is the predominant attribute controlling
  the flow behavior of complex-shaped granular material. The general strengths and
  weaknesses in the applicability of those models for the milled biomass modeling
  are summarized. In particular, comments are provided to balance the numerical model
  capabilities and the computational cost for the development of DEM models. To our
  best knowledge, this is the first-of-its-kind review on DEM specifically for biomass.
  Our study indicates that the current DEM models require further development, calibration,
  and validation based on a deep understanding of biomass particle contact mechanics
  and experimental data support before they can be reliably used for predictive simulations
  in handling and feeding systems.
