abstract: Electronic equipment in data centers generates heat during operation, which
  should be dissipated through a cooling system to prevent overheating and maintain
  optimal performance. Electricity consumption for the data center cooling system
  becomes significant as the demand for data-intensive services increases. Although
  various technologies have been developed and integrated into the data center cooling
  system, there are limited high-efficiency alternatives for data center cooling.
  In this study, we designed a reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) system that
  stores cooling energy during winters and produces it during summers for data center
  cooling. We then demonstrated the techno-economic performance of the RTES incorporated
  with dry coolers and heat recovery for a year-round 5Â MW cooling load. The RTES
  cooling production was reliable during the 20-year lifetime. We estimated the levelized
  cost of cooling as $5/MWh, significantly lower than $15/MWh for the base scenario
  where chillers and dry coolers supply the same cooling load without the RTES. We
  also estimated that the RTES-based cooling system annually avoids CO2 emissions
  up to 1488 tCO2e compared to the base case. These results highlight techno-economic
  feasibility and environmental benefits of the RTES and its potential to be deployed
  for various applications at large scales as well as for data center cooling.
