abstract: Based on the fractal-percolation properties, the equivalent permeability
  analysis of 3-D discrete fracture network models are investigated and analyzed for
  the first time. The 3-D fractal dimension was calculated with the 3-D fracture density,
  the mean major axis of fracture and the aspect ratio of major to minor axis. The
  reconstructed mining-induced fracture network model was used to validate that the
  correlation between the predicted and actual results is very strong in a sense.
  The equivalent permeability results can be adopted to guide the gas extraction in
  coal mines.
