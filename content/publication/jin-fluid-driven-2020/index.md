abstract: In this paper, a numerical method is proposed to simulate multi-scale fracture
  propagation driven by ﬂuid injection in transversely isotropic porous media. Intrinsic
  anisotropy is accounted for at the continuum scale, by using a damage model in which
  two equivalent strains are deﬁned to distinguish mechanical behavior in the direction
  parallel and perpendicular to the layer. Nonlocal equivalent strains are calculated
  by integration and are directly introduced in the damage evolution law. When the
  weighted damage exceeds a certain threshold, the transition from continuum damage
  to cohesive fracture is performed by dynamically inserting cohesive segments. Diffusion
  equations are used to model ﬂuid ﬂow inside the porous matrix and within the macro-fracture,
  in which conductivity is obtained by Darcy’s law and the cubic law, respectively.
  In the fractured elements, the displacement and pore pressure ﬁelds are discretized
  by using the XFEM technique. Interpolation on fracture elements is enriched with
  jump functions for displacements and with level set-based distance functions for
  ﬂuid pressure, which ensures that displacements are discontinuous across the fracture,
  but that the pressure ﬁeld remains continuous. After spatial and temporal discretization,
  the model is implemented in a Matlab code. Simulations are carried out in plane
  strain. The results validate the formulation and implementation of the proposed
  model and further demonstrate that it can account for material and stress anisotropy.
