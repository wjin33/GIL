 abstract = {In situ gas extraction is the main measure adopted by mines to achieve mining safety standards. Coal permeability is significantly influenced by coal shrinkage during gas release. Based on effective stress and additional damage that resulted from gas extraction, a unique model was proposed to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of coal permeability within the effective influence zone. Calculation models for the conditions of one and two extracting boreholes were developed. A parametric study on both two models was also conducted, in which the effect of extraction time, extraction pressure, interval between two boreholes, and extraction pressure combination were qualitatively analyzed. The results demonstrated that with the increase of extraction time, gas extraction can result in less permeability reduction in the beginning but can enhance permeability. Coal permeability obviously increases when extraction time increases but gradually stabilizes, presenting “high middle and low around” surrounding the extracting borehole. Meanwhile, a decreasing relative amplification implies that permeability ratio does not increase linearly with the increase in extraction pressure. Both intervals between two extracting boreholes and different combinations of extraction pressure significantly influence the distribution of coal permeability. A comparison with some previous permeability studies was conducted to validate the proposed model, and the predicted evolution results matched the permeability testing data. In conclusion, the proposed model is consistent with the phenomenon in real engineering, and the model results can provide preliminary guidance for the design of extracting borehole distribution.},
