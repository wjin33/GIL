abstract: Roof-coal recovery rate and the performance of gas extraction are essentially
  controlled by the fractures within coal-rock mass. Thus, it is important to generate
  the accurate fracture network ahead of mining face. In this study, ten boreholes
  located differently from the 8212 working face of Tashan Mine in Datong coal mining
  group, China, were drilled. With the help of borehole video instruments, the location,
  orientation of each fracture and the fracture number of different intersection type
  on each borehole wall were mapped with the advancing of mining face. These data
  were analyzed using the Matlab Toolbox RJNS3D and Dips to determine structural homogeneity
  zone, to find the number of fracture sets that exist in the coal-rock mass, volume
  density frequency for each set and the probability distributions of orientation,
  fracture size in 3-D. Sampling biases associated with orientation, spacing were
  corrected during the process. The constructed fracture networks were validated by
  comparing the observed mean spacing along normal vector of mean orientation for
  each set and the predict value on similar scanlines.
