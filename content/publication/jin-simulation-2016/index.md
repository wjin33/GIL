abstract: The objective of this work is to simulate mode II multi-scale fracture propagation
  in shale by coupling a continuum anisotropic damage model with a Cohesive Zone Model
  (CZM). The Continuum Damage Mechanics – based Differential Stress Induced Damage
  (DSID) model is used to represent micro-scale crack evolution. DSID parameters were
  calibrated against pre-peak points of stress/strain curves obtained experimentally
  during triaxial compression tests performed in Bakken shale. A bilinear CZM is employed
  to represent macroscale fracture propagation. We calculated the effective shear
  modulus of a continuum that contained a distribution of parallel cracks according
  to the DSID model (which does not account for crack interactions) and according
  to Kachanov’s micromechanical model (which accounts for crack interactions). Simulations
  confirmed that above a crack density or damage of 0.3, crack interactions could
  not be ignored, and we used that threshold to define the transition between continuum
  damage propagation and discrete fracture propagation and subsequently, to calibrate
  the shear cohesive strength of the CZM. The CZM cohesive energy release rate was
  determined by calibrating a numerical model of triaxial compression test against
  experimental data obtained on Bakken shale. The cylindrical sample was modeled with
  a CZM to pre-define an inclined cohesive fracture, and the DSID model was assigned
  to the surrounding elements. We used our calibrated CZM-DSID model to simulate a
  biaxial compression test in plane strain. Results clearly show that the proposed
  modeling strategy not only allows simulating the advancement of macro-fracture tips,
  but also captures the inception and growth of micro-cracks that form damaged zones,
  as well as the transition between smeared damage and discrete fracture.
