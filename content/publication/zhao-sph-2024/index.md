abstract: Numerical modeling of granular biomass material flow in handling operations
  is indispensable to decipher flow upsets, commonly manifested as clogging and jamming
  in hoppers and augers. With a computational tool developed based on smoothed particle
  hydrodynamics (SPH), we simulated the hopper flow and auger feeding of six granular
  biomass materials. The good agreement between the experimental and numerical flow
  rates demonstrated the capability of the developed SPH solver in modeling the complicated
  flow of granular biomass materials. The impact of physical and numerical parameters
  is investigated, and the major results show that the hopper flow pattern is controlled
  by shear band evolution; hopper clogging is collectively influenced by the opening
  size, wall friction, and material packing, and the impact of material compressibility
  on the auger feed rate is minimal. These parametric studies validate the solverâ€™s
  robustness in simulating biomass flow in handling equipment and demonstrate that
  the SPH computational tool can provide insights about granular flow mechanics to
  facilitate handling equipment design and optimize handling operations.
