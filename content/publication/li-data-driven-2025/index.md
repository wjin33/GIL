abstract: Significant equipment downtime, mainly caused by the variable attributes
  and complex mechanical behavior of granular biomass materials, has challenged the
  great potential of biofuel generation. Expensive and time-consuming lab experiments
  are not affordable in fully characterizing material behavior for samples with all
  possible attributes. In this paper, we present data-driven modeling of the cyclic
  axial compression and ring-shear stressâ€“strain behavior for granular biomass materials
  with different moisture contents and mean particle sizes. Laboratory characterization
  data of milled pine samples, with a mean particle size of 2, 4, and 6 mm and a moisture
  content of 0%, 20%, and 40%, were employed to train two machine learning (ML) models
  independently. The sequential model takes a sequence of loading history into Gated
  Recurrent Units (GRU) and predicts the next step of strain/stress with a feed-forward
  neural network. In contrast, the incremental model takes only the current state
  to predict the stiffness/compliance coefficient and compute the stress/strain increment.
  Both models account for material variations in particle sizes and moisture content.
  After training, both models demonstrate their high efficiency and accuracy in predicting
  the mechanical behavior of samples with a diverse set of unseen material properties,
  augmenting the existing laboratory data set. They also effectively capture the underlying
  physics, which involves increased compressibility as moisture content rises and
  a linear relationship between applied compression and shear strength. This effort
  established the foundation for comprehensive data-driven constitutive modeling tailored
  for unconventional granular materials.
