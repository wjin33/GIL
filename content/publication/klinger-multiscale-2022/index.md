abstract: One dominant challenge facing the development of biorefineries is achieving
  consistent system throughput with highly variant biomass feedstock quality and handling
  performance. Current handling unit operations are adapted from other sectors (primarily
  agriculture), where some simplifying assumptions about granular mechanics and flow
  performance do not translate well to a highly compressible and anisotropic material
  with nonlinear time- and stress-dependent properties. This work explores the shear
  and frictional properties of loblolly pine at multiple experimental test apparatus
  and particle scales to elucidate a property window that defines the shear behavior
  over a range of material attributes (particle size, size distribution, moisture
  content, etc.). In general, it was observed that the bulk internal friction and
  apparent cohesion depend strongly on both the stress state of the sample in granular
  shear testers and the overall particle size and distribution span. For equipment
  designed to characterize the quasi-static shear stress failure of bulk materials
  ranging from 50 to 1,000 ml in test volume, similar test results were observed for
  finely milled particles (50% passing size of 1.4 mm) with a narrow size distribution
  (span between 10 and 90% passing size of 0.9 mm), while stress chaining and over-torque
  issues persisted for the bench-scale test apparatus for larger particle sizes or
  widely dispersed sample sizes. Measurement of the anisotropic particle–particle
  friction ranged from coefficients of approximately 0.20 to 0.45 and resulted in
  significantly higher and more variable friction measurements for larger particle
  sizes and in perpendicular alignment orientations. To supplement these laboratory-scale
  properties, this work explores the flow of loblolly pine and Douglas fir through
  a pilot-scale wedge-shaped hopper and a screw feeder. For the gravity-driven hopper
  flow, the critical arching distance and mass discharge rate ranged from approximately
  10 to 30 mm and 2 to 16 tons/hour, respectively, for both materials, where the arching
  distance depends strongly on the overall particle size and depends less on the hopper
  inclination angle. Comparatively, the auger feeder was found to be much more impacted
  by the size of the particles, where smaller particles had a more consistent and
  stable flow while consuming less power.
