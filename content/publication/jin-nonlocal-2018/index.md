abstract: 'Upon crack propagation, brittle geomaterials such as concrete and rock
  exhibit a nonlinear stress/strain behavior, damage induced stiffness anisotropy,
  loading path dependent strain softening and hardening, unilateral effects due to
  crack closure and a brittle-ductile transition, which depends on the confining pressure.
  Challenges in theoretical and numerical modeling include the distinction between
  tensile and compressive fracture propagation modes, mesh dependency during softening,
  and lack of convergence when several critical points are expected on the stress/strain
  curve. To overcome these issues, we formulate a nonlocal micromechanics based anisotropic
  damage model. A dilute homogenization scheme is adopted for calculating the deformation
  energy of the Representative Elementary Volume due to the displacement jumps at
  open and closed micro-cracks. Tension (respectively compression) damage criteria
  are expressed in terms of non-local equivalent strains defined in terms of positive
  principal strains (respectively deviatoric strains). Constitutive parameters are
  calibrated against published experimental data for concrete and shale. We employ
  the arc-length control method to solve boundary-value problems with the finite element
  package OOFEM: the algorithm allows capturing softening, snap back and snap through.
  We simulate the development of the compression damage zone around a cavity under
  various stress levels at the wall and far field, and the softening behavior consequent
  to tensile fracture propagation during a three-point bending test. No mesh dependency
  is noted during softening as long as micro-cracks do not interact.'
