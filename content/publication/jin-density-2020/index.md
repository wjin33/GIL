abstract: Integrated biorefineries suffer from equipment down-time due to poor understanding
  of the flowability of biomass-derived feedstock. This work presents the characterization
  of the mechanical behavior of ground loblolly pine by combining physical experiments
  and numerical simulations. A modified Drucker-Prager/Cap (MDPC) model enhanced with
  density dependence is used for finite element modeling. Cyclic oedometer tests with
  increased magnitude of compressive stress and Schulze ring shear tests are performed
  to characterize material compressibility and shear behavior. The laboratory tests
  yield stress-strain curves, density-stress curves and Mohr-Coulomb shear envelopes,
  which are then used directly and indirectly to calibrate elasticity, as well as
  cap and shear failure parameters of the MDPC model. Full size 3D Schulze ring shear
  tests are modeled in Abaqus with calibrated model parameters, and the simulated
  Mohr-Coulomb envelops match well against experimental results, indicating the stress
  state within the shear band of the ring shear test is close to triaxial compression.
  The modeling results also show the MDPC model does not predict dilation followed
  by constant volume as observed by experiments. The mechanical behavior derived from
  the experiments and the methodology proposed for model calibration and stress state
  characterization provide a foundation for studying biomass flow behavior in material
  feeding and handling equipment.
