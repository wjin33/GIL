abstract: The design of efficient material-handling systems for milled lignocellulosic
  biomass is challenging due to their complex particle morphologies and frictional
  interactions. Computational modeling, including the discrete element method (DEM)
  and continuum-based finite-element/volume methods, may offer scientific insight
  and predictive capabilities for the flow of milled biomass in hoppers and feeders.
  This article (Part II) presents a review of current state-of-the-art continuum models
  for the flow of milled biomass, whereas DEM models are reviewed in a companion article
  (Part I). Advances of numerical methods to solve the global governing equations
  are discussed first, followed by a comprehensive review of constitutive models for
  granular materials, including Druckerâ€“Prager, hypoplastic, Cambridge-type, inertial-rheology,
  and nonlocal granular fluidity models. Specifically, we provide in-depth discussion
  on the suitability of those models for milled lignocellulosic biomass materials
  in terms of nonlinear elasticity, dependence of flow strength on pressure, density
  and shear rate, and compaction (dilation) associated with hardening (softening).
  Our study shows that, despite the recent advances in continuum granular flow modeling,
  the most suitable constitutive models still need further development to account
  for material parametrization, multiflow regimes, and multiscale behavior before
  they can be reliably used to optimize the design and operation of biomass handling
  systems.
