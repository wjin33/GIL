abstract: High-temperature reservoir thermal energy storage (HT-RTES) has the potential
  to become an indispensable component in achieving the goal of the net-zero carbon
  economy, given its capability to balance the intermittent nature of renewable energy
  generation. In this study, a machine-learning-assisted computational framework is
  presented to identify HT-RTES site with optimal performance metrics by combining
  physics-based simulation with stochastic hydrogeologic formation and thermal energy
  storage operation parameters, artificial neural network regression of the simulation
  data, and genetic algorithm-enabled multi-objective optimization. A doublet well
  configuration with a layered (aquitard-aquifer-aquitard) generic reservoir is simulated
  for cases of continuous operation and seasonal-cycle operation scenarios. Neural
  network-based surrogate models are developed for the two scenarios and applied to
  generate the Pareto fronts of the HT-RTES performance for four potential HT-RTES
  sites. The developed Pareto optimal solutions indicate the performance of HT-RTES
  is operation-scenario (i.e., fluid cycle) and reservoir-site dependent, and the
  performance metrics have competing effects for a given site and a given fluid cycle.
  The developed neural network models can be applied to identify suitable sites for
  HT-RTES, and the proposed framework sheds light on the design of resilient HT-RTES
  systems.
