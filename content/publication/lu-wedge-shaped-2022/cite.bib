 abstract = {The bioenergy industry has been challenged by unstable flow and transport of milled biomass in material handling operations. Handling issues such as hopper clogging and auger jamming are attributed to knowledge gaps between existing handling units designed for bulk solids and their suitability for milled biomass with high compressibility. This work investigates various flow behaviors of granular woody biomass in wedge-shaped hoppers. Hopper flow physical experiments and numerical simulations are conducted to study the influence of the critical material attributes and critical processing parameters on the flow pattern, arching, and throughput. The results show that (1) the preferred flow pattern, mass flow, can be achieved by controlling the material’s internal friction angle, hopper inclination, and hopper wall friction; (2) hopper arching, governed by the competing gravity-driven force against flow resistance from material internal friction and material–wall friction, can be controlled by the hopper wall friction angle and the inclination angle; and (3) flow throughput can be accurately estimated from our empirical equation with inputs of hopper outlet geometry and particle-scale to bulk-scale material attributes. This study elucidates woody biomass flow physics and provides guidance for industrial equipment design.},
