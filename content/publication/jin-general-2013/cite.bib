 abstract = {In this study, the issue of multiple collinear cracks in a finite plate is studied, and the overall stress field as well as stress intensity factors (SIFs) near crack tips are determined. Based on Muskelishviliâ€™s results, the problem is formulated using complex functions in terms of unknown coefficients, which are obtained by enforcing the external boundaries using a least-square boundary collocation method. These functions satisfy all the required conditions, and can be used to calculate the overall stress field, displacement field and the SIFs at the crack tips. Examples of a rectangular plate with one, two and three cracks, respectively, have been calculated, and a set of photoelastic experiments were performed and the results are supportive. At the end, the effect of confining stress, friction coefficient, crack orientation and the distance between crack tips on SIF are investigated.},
