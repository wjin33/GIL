abstract: The upstream of bioenergy industry has suffered from unreliable operations
  of granular biomass feedstocks in handling equipment. Computational modeling, including
  continuum-mechanics models and discrete-particle models, offers insightful understandings
  and predictive capabilities on the flow of milled biomass and can assist equipment
  design and optimization. This paper presents a benchmark study on the fidelity of
  the continuum and discrete modeling approaches for predicting granular biomass flow.
  We first introduce the constitutive law of the continuum-mechanics model and the
  contact law of the coarse-grained discrete-particle model, with model parameters
  calibrated against laboratory characterization tests of the milled loblolly pine.
  Three classical granular material flow systems (i.e., a lab-scale rotating drum,
  a pilot-scale hopper, and a full-scale inclined plane) are then simulated using
  the two models with the same initial and boundary conditions as the physical experiments.
  The close agreement of the numerical predictions with the experimental measurements
  on the hopper mass flow rate, the hopper critical outlet width, the material stopping
  thickness on the inclined plane, and the dynamic angle of repose, clearly indicates
  that the two methods can capture the critical flow behavior of granular biomass.
  The qualitative comparison shows that the continuum-mechanics model outperforms
  in parameterization of materials and wall friction, and large-scale systems, while
  the discrete-particle model is more preferred for discontinuous flow systems at
  smaller scales. Industry stakeholders can use these findings as guidance for choosing
  appropriate numerical tools to model biomass material flow in part of the optimization
  of material handling equipment in biorefineries.
