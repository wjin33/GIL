abstract: The discrete damage model presented in this paper accounts for 42 non-interacting
  crack microplanes directions. At the scale of the representative volume element,
  the free enthalpy is the sum of the elastic energy stored in the non-damaged bulk
  material and in the displacement jumps at crack faces. Closed cracks propagate in
  the pure mode II, whereas open cracks propagate in the mixed mode (I/II). The elastic
  domain is at the intersection of the yield surfaces of the activated crack families,
  and thus describes a non-smooth surface. In order to solve for the 42 crack densities,
  a Closest Point Projection algorithm is adopted locally. The representative volume
  element inelastic strain is calculated iteratively using the Newton–Raphson method.
  The proposed damage model was rigorously calibrated for both compressive and tensile
  stress paths. Finite element method simulations of triaxial compression tests showed
  that the transition between brittle and ductile behavior at increasing confining
  pressure can be captured. The cracks’ density, orientation, and location predicted
  in the simulations are in agreement with experimental observations made during compression
  and tension tests, and accurately show the difference between tensile and compressive
  strength. Plane stress tension tests simulated for a fiber-reinforced brittle material
  also demonstrated that the model can be used to interpret crack patterns, design
  composite structures and recommend reparation techniques for structural elements
  subjected to multiple damage mechanisms.
