 abstract = {Abstract. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of addressing the cooling needs for information technology (IT) equipment in data centers by using reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) to provide reliable and sustainable low-temperature fluid. This project focuses on the technical viability of operating such a system in Houston, Texas, which is a representative location for crypto mining data centers. An analysis has been performed to investigate the technical feasibility with climate data for Houston. Results show that data centers on the scale of 30 MW, and operating at a temperature of 27Â°C, can be reliably cooled by a combined RTES and dry coolers setup. A techno-economic analysis will be performed and energy/water saving benefits will be quantified in the future. In addition, the study will be extended to other representative data center locations with different climates and geographical locations.},
