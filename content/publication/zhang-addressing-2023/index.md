abstract: Abstract. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of addressing the
  cooling needs for information technology (IT) equipment in data centers by using
  reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) to provide reliable and sustainable low-temperature
  fluid. This project focuses on the technical viability of operating such a system
  in Houston, Texas, which is a representative location for crypto mining data centers.
  An analysis has been performed to investigate the technical feasibility with climate
  data for Houston. Results show that data centers on the scale of 30 MW, and operating
  at a temperature of 27Â°C, can be reliably cooled by a combined RTES and dry coolers
  setup. A techno-economic analysis will be performed and energy/water saving benefits
  will be quantified in the future. In addition, the study will be extended to other
  representative data center locations with different climates and geographical locations.
