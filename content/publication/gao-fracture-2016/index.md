abstract: The size of a fracture within a rock mass can be obtained using data sampled
  from boreholes or exposed surfaces. In this study, fracture sizes are estimated
  using data from multiple boreholes. The fractures are assumed to be elliptical,
  all having the same aspect ratio, but not necessarily occurring parallel to each
  other. Formulae for estimating the mean and standard deviation of the characteristic
  fracture size are developed by considering the number of intersections between the
  fractures and the boreholes. A method is proposed to infer the probability density
  function of the fracture size from the number of fractures, which is obtained by
  random sampling of fractures in adjacent boreholes; the fracture distribution is
  assumed to follow the form of a fractal, exponential, or lognormal distribution.
  The performance of the method is validated using Monte Carlo simulations with different
  inputs of size distribution, fracture density, orientation, and mean fracture size.
