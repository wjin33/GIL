abstract: Poor understanding of the flow behavior of granular biomass material poses
  great challenges for the bioenergy industry, as the equipment functioning time is
  significantly reduced by handling issues like screw feeder clogging and hopper arching.
  In this work, the flow behavior of loblolly pine chips, including the mass flow
  rate and the critical outlet width, in a wedge-shaped hopper is investigated by
  combining physical experiments and numerical simulations. Comprehensive characterization
  of the flow response affected by the two material attributes (initial packing, particle
  density) and the three operational parameters (hopper outlet width, hopper inclination,
  and surcharge) is conducted. The results show that the hopper outlet width linearly
  controls the mass flow rate, while the hopper inclination angle controls the critical
  outlet size. The packing determines whether the flow is smooth or surging, and the
  surcharge-induced compaction creates flow impedance. The magnitude of these influences
  varies from a slender hopper with a low inclination angle to a flat-bottom silo.
  These findings provide guidance for hopper operation in the material handling industry
  and shed light on the construction of a novel design method for material handling
  equipment in biorefineries.
