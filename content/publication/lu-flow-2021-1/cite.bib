 abstract = {Poor understanding of the flow behavior of granular biomass material poses great challenges for the bioenergy industry, as the equipment functioning time is significantly reduced by handling issues like screw feeder clogging and hopper arching. In this work, the flow behavior of loblolly pine chips, including the mass flow rate and the critical outlet width, in a wedge-shaped hopper is investigated by combining physical experiments and numerical simulations. Comprehensive characterization of the flow response affected by the two material attributes (initial packing, particle density) and the three operational parameters (hopper outlet width, hopper inclination, and surcharge) is conducted. The results show that the hopper outlet width linearly controls the mass flow rate, while the hopper inclination angle controls the critical outlet size. The packing determines whether the flow is smooth or surging, and the surcharge-induced compaction creates flow impedance. The magnitude of these influences varies from a slender hopper with a low inclination angle to a flat-bottom silo. These findings provide guidance for hopper operation in the material handling industry and shed light on the construction of a novel design method for material handling equipment in biorefineries.},
