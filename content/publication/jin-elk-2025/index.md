abstract: ABSTRACT:. Multistage hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized the oil and
  gas industry, particularly enabling the rapid growth of shale gas production in
  the U.S. However, for unconventional subsurface resource recovery, such as geothermal
  energy extraction in super-hot formations and in situ mineral leaching, hydraulic
  fracturing faces significant challenges, including packer leakage, short-circuiting,
  insufficient surface area for effective reactions, and water contamination. Electro-hydraulic
  fracturing - a combination of electric shocking, thermal shocking, and hydraulic
  fracturing - has been proposed to address these issues. Laboratory results have
  shown great promise for this technology in unconventional subsurface stimulation.
  However, scaling it up and deploying it in the field requires guidance from numerical
  simulations. This paper presents ELK (ELectro-fracKing), a computational tool designed
  to model electro-hydraulic fracturing processes. ELK is built on the open-source,
  parallel MOOSE (Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment) framework,
  using the finite-element method. ELK solves the momentum balance and mass conservation
  equations for hydraulic fracturing using numerical techniques such as the discontinuous
  Galerkin method, cohesive zone models, and multiphase, multicomponent fluid-flow
  simulations. This allows ELK to simulate proppant-fluid mixture-driven fracture
  propagation, proppant transport and settling, and fracture closure with proppant
  compaction. ELK solves the coupled dynamic hydromechanical governing equations for
  electric shocking (i.e., pulsed-power-induced fracturing). A damage model and permeability
  and stiffness evolution constitutive laws have been incorporated to simulate multi-fracture
  propagation in saturated environments. ELK solves part of the Maxwell Equations
  for thermal shock under low and constant current frequency (i.e., electro-quasi-static).
  We validate each modeling capability against laboratory results and analytical solutions.
  ELK offers a valuable computational tool for advancing unconventional subsurface
  resource extraction.
