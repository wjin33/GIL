abstract: The promise of biomass-derived biofuels is often overshadowed by intricate
  material handling challenges such as hopper clogging and screw feeder jamming. These
  handling issues stem from the knowledge gap among particle-scale material properties
  (e.g., particle size), bulk-scale material attributes (e.g., relative density),
  macro-scale equipment design (e.g., hopper inclination), and flow performance (e.g.,
  probability of clogging). This work combines physical experiments, validated numerical
  simulations, and data augmentation to develop a machine learning-based hopper design
  for flowing granular woody biomass materials. The flow behavior of granular biomass
  is simulated and validated against physical tests utilizing the developed smoothed
  particle hydrodynamics (SPH) solver and a modified hypoplastic model. A comprehensive
  evaluation of the flow performance, including flow rate, flow stability, and flow
  pattern, is conducted on an extensive data set encompassing various biomass particle
  sizes, moisture contents, relative densities, and hopper operating conditions. A
  feed-forward neural network is trained and optimized with this data set to correlate
  cross-scale attributes with the flow performance metrics. The results reveal promising
  predictive accuracy on seen and unseen data sets. Further evaluation of how various
  input attributes affect the predicted flow performance metrics is carried out. The
  results indicate that hopper opening width primarily dictates flow throughput, while
  relative density, wall friction, inclination angle, and hopper opening width collectively
  impact flow stability. Additionally, flow patterns are predominantly governed by
  relative density, wall friction, and inclination angle. Moreover, the clogging potential
  is found to be exclusively characterized by the index dedicated to flow stability.
  The combination of high moisture contents, dense packing, smooth wall friction,
  low inclination angles, and small hopper opening widths substantially elevates the
  risk of unstable flows and clogging. This study serves as a potent design tool for
  flowing milled woody biomass materials in hoppers for all stakeholders in biorefineries
  and equipment manufacturing.
