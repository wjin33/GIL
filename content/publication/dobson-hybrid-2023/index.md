abstract: 'Abstract. One of the critical challenges of the green energy transition
  is resolving the mismatch between energy generation provided by intermittent renewable
  energy sources such as solar and wind and the demand for energy. There is a need
  for large amounts of energy storage over a range of time scales (diurnal to seasonal)
  to better balance energy supply and demand. Subsurface geologic reservoirs provide
  the potential for storage of hot water that can be retrieved when needed and used
  for power generation or direct-use applications, such as district heating. It is
  important to identify potential issues associated with high-temperature reservoir
  thermal energy storage (HT-RTES) systems so that they can be mitigated, thus reducing
  the risks of these systems. This paper reviews past experiences from moderate and
  high-temperature reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) projects, along with hot
  water and steam flood enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations, to identify technical
  challenges encountered and evaluate possible ways to address them. Some of the identified
  technical problems that have impacted system performance include: 1) insufficient
  site characterization that failed to identify reservoir heterogeneity; 2) scaling
  resulting from precipitation of minerals having retrograde solubility that form
  with heating of formation brines; 3) corrosion from low pH or high salinity brines;
  4) thermal breakthrough between hot and cold wells due to insufficient spacing.
  Proper design, characterization, construction, and operational practices can help
  reduce the risk of technical problems that could lead to reduced performance of
  these thermal energy storage systems.'
