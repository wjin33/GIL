abstract: State-of-the-Art models of Root System Architecture (RSA) do not allow simulating
  root growth around rigid obstacles. Yet, the presence of obstacles can be highly
  disruptive to the root system. We grew wheat seedlings in sealed petri dishes without
  obstacle and in custom 3D-printed rhizoboxes containing obstacles. Time-lapse photography
  was used to reconstruct the wheat root morphology network. We used the reconstructed
  wheat root network without obstacle to calibrate an RSA model implemented in the
  R-SWMS software. The root network with obstacles allowed calibrating the parameters
  of a new function that models the influence of rigid obstacles on wheat root growth.
  Experimental results show that the presence of a rigid obstacle does not affect
  the growth rate of the wheat root axes, but that it does influence the root trajectory
  after the main axis has passed the obstacle. The growth recovery time, i.e. the
  time for the main root axis to recover its geotropism-driven growth, is proportional
  to the time during which the main axis grows along the obstacle. Qualitative and
  quantitative comparisons between experimental and numerical results show that the
  proposed model successfully simulates wheat RSA growth around obstacles. Our results
  suggest that wheat roots follow patterns that could inspire the design of adaptive
  engineering flow networks.
