bio: Ph.D. student in Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University specializing in reservoir geomechanics and hydraulic-fracturing simulation. I develop GPU/CUDA-accelerated, high-performance lattice-method solvers to model coupled Mode I/II/III fracture initiation and propagation in heterogeneous formations, including fracture-swarm behavior. Prior work includes deep learning for EOR, petrophysical characterization, and time-series well-production forecasting. My goal is to translate fracture mechanics into design insights that reduce costs and enhance recovery.
